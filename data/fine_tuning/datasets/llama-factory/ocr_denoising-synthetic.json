Dismissing Bianca, he made such\nsubmissions to the Marquis, and threw in such artful encomiums on\nMatilda, that Frederic was once more staggered. However, as his passion\nwas of so recent a date, it could not at once surmount the scruples he\nhad conceived. He had gathered enough from Bianca\u2019s discourse to\npersuade him that heaven declared itself against Manfred. The proposed\nmarriages too removed his claim to a distance; and the principality of\nOtranto was a stronger temptation than the contingent reversion of it\nwith Matilda. Still he would not absolutely recede from his engagements;\nbut purposing to gain time, he demanded of Manfred if it was true in fact\nthat Hippolita consented to the divorce. The Prince, transported to find\nno other obstacle, and depending on his influence over his wife, assured\nthe Marquis it was so, and that he might satisfy himself of the truth\nfrom her own mouth.\n\nAs they were thus discoursing, word was brought that the banquet was\nprepared. Manfred conducted Frederic to the great hall, where they were\nreceived by Hippolita and the young Princesses. Manfred placed the\nMarquis next to Matilda, and seated himself between his wife and\nIsabella. Hippolita comported herself with an easy gravity; but the\nyoung ladies were silent and melancholy."

My\nspirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past\nwas blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future\ngilded by bright rays of hope, and anticipations of joy.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\n\"I now hasten to the more moving part of my story."

Her eyes were so often cast down on\nmeeting his, that Isabella, who regarded Theodore as attentively as he\ngazed on Matilda, soon divined who the object was that he had told her in\nthe cave engaged his affections. While this mute scene passed, Hippolita\ndemanded of Frederic the cause of his having taken that mysterious course\nfor reclaiming his daughter; and threw in various apologies to excuse her\nLord for the match contracted between their children.\n\nFrederic, however incensed against Manfred, was not insensible to the\ncourtesy and benevolence of Hippolita: but he was still more struck with\nthe lovely form of Matilda. Wishing to detain them by his bedside, he\ninformed Hippolita of his story. He told her that, while prisoner to the\ninfidels, he had dreamed that his daughter, of whom he had learned no\nnews since his captivity, was detained in a castle, where she was in\ndanger of the most dreadful misfortunes: and that if he obtained his\nliberty, and repaired to a wood near Joppa, he would learn more. Alarmed\nat this dream, and incapable of obeying the direction given by it, his\nchains became more grievous than ever. But while his thoughts were\noccupied on the means of obtaining his liberty, he received the agreeable\nnews that the confederate Princes who were warring in Palestine had paid\nhis ransom.

Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties of\na servant; a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include\nthe idea of ignorance, and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.\n\n\"Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I\nrecollect you once remarked, that if you were in an ill-humour, one\nglance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that\nAriosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica--she looked so\nfrank-hearted and happy.

My mule was\nbrought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of\nMontanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and\never-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it. It\nhad then filled me with a sublime ecstasy, that gave wings to the soul,\nand allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy. The\nsight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect\nof solemnising my mind, and causing me to forget the passing cares of\nlife. I determined to go without a guide, for I was well acquainted with\nthe path, and the presence of another would destroy the solitary\ngrandeur of the scene.\n\nThe ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short\nwindings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the\nmountain.

In a thousand spots the\ntraces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken\nand strewed on the ground; some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning\nupon the jutting rocks of the mountain, or transversely upon other\ntrees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines of\nsnow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is\nparticularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in\na loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw\ndestruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or\nluxuriant, but they are sombre, and add an air of severity to the scene.\nI looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers\nwhich ran through it, and curling in thick wreaths"

My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and\nsyndics; and my father had filled several public situations with honour\nand reputation.

He passed his younger\ndays perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of\ncircumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until the\ndecline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family.\n\nAs the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot\nrefrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a\nmerchant, who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous\nmischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a\nproud and unbending disposition, and could not bear to live in poverty\nand oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been\ndistinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,\ntherefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter\nto the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My\nfather loved Beaufort with the truest friendship, and was deeply grieved\nby his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He bitterly deplored\nthe false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of\nthe affection that united them. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek\nhim out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again\nthrough his credit and assistance.\n\nBeaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself; and it was ten\nmonths before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this\ndiscovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean\nstreet, near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone\nwelcomed him."

M.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.\n\n\nThe following work was found in the library of an ancient Catholic family\nin the north of England. It was printed at Naples, in the black letter,\nin the year 1529. How much sooner it was written does not appear. The\nprincipal incidents are such as were believed in the darkest ages of\nChristianity; but the language and conduct have nothing that savours of\nbarbarism. The style is the purest Italian.\n\nIf the story was written near the time when it is supposed to have\nhappened, it must have been between 1095, the era of the first Crusade,\nand 1243, the date of the last, or not long afterwards. There is no\nother circumstance in the work that can lead us to guess at the period in\nwhich the scene is laid: the names of the actors are evidently\nfictitious, and probably disguised on purpose: yet the Spanish names of\nthe domestics seem to indicate that this work was not composed until the\nestablishment of the Arragonian Kings in Naples had made Spanish\nappellations familiar in that country."

The patriarchal lives of\nmy protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind;\nperhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young\nsoldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should have been imbued with\ndifferent sensations.\n\n\"But 'Paradise Lost' excited different and far deeper emotions. I read\nit, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as\na true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe, that the\npicture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of\nexciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity\nstruck me, to my own."

But Jerome\u2019s new presumption, so dissonant from his former\nmeekness, suggested still deeper apprehensions. The Prince even\nsuspected that the Friar depended on some secret support from Frederic,\nwhose arrival, coinciding with the novel appearance of Theodore, seemed\nto bespeak a correspondence. Still more was he troubled with the\nresemblance of Theodore to Alfonso\u2019s portrait. The latter he knew had\nunquestionably died without issue. Frederic had consented to bestow\nIsabella on him. These contradictions agitated his mind with numberless\npangs.\n\nHe saw but two methods of extricating himself from his difficulties. The\none was to resign his dominions to the Marquis\u2014pride, ambition, and his\nreliance on ancient prophecies, which had pointed out a possibility of\nhis preserving them to his posterity, combated that thought. The other\nwas to press his marriage with Isabella. After long ruminating on these\nanxious thoughts, as he marched silently with Hippolita to the castle, he\nat last discoursed with that Princess on the subject of his disquiet, and\nused every insinuating and plausible argument to extract her consent to,\neven her promise of promoting the divorce. Hippolita needed little\npersuasions to bend her to his pleasure. She endeavoured to win him over\nto the measure of resigning his dominions; but finding her exhortations\nfruitless, she assured him, that as far as her conscience would allow,\nshe would raise no opposition to a separation, though without better\nfounded scruples than what he yet alleged, she would not engage to be\nactive in demanding it.\n\nThis compliance, though inadequate, was sufficient to raise Manfred\u2019s\nhopes. He trusted that his power and wealth would easily advance his\nsuit at the court of Rome, whither he resolved to engage Frederic to take\na journey on purpose."

She continued her course along the precipitous sides of the\nriver, when suddenly her foot slipt, and she fell into the rapid\nstream. I rushed from my hiding-place; and, with extreme labour from the\nforce of the current, saved her, and dragged her to shore. She was\nsenseless; and I endeavoured, by every means in my power, to restore\nanimation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,\nwho was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On seeing\nme, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms, hastened\ntowards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I hardly knew\nwhy; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he\ncarried, at my body, and fired. I sunk to the ground, and my injurer,\nwith increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.\n\n\"This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being\nfrom destruction, and, as a recompense, I now writhed under the\nmiserable pain of a wound, which shattered the flesh and bone. The\nfeelings of kindness and gentleness, which I had entertained but a few\nmoments before, gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth.\nInflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind.\nBut the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.\n\n\"For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to\ncure the wound which I had received."

This winter has been passed most miserably, tortured\nas I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your\ncountenance, and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort\nand tranquillity.\n\n\"Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable\na year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you at\nthis period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you; but a conversation\nthat I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some\nexplanation necessary before we meet.\n\n\"Explanation! you may possibly say; what can Elizabeth have to explain?\nIf you really say this, my questions are answered, and all my doubts\nsatisfied."

She appeared affected by\ndifferent feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held\nout her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously, and called her, as\nwell as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to\nunderstand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and dismissing\nher guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some conversation took place\nbetween him and his father; and the young stranger knelt at the old\nman's feet, and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her, and\nembraced her affectionately."

But even if I were condemned to\nsuffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places\nwith such a wretch.\"\n\nI listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed,\nbut in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my\ncountenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, \"My dearest friend, you\nmust calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how deeply;\nbut I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of despair,\nand sometimes of revenge, in your countenance, that makes me tremble.\nDear Victor, banish these dark passions. Remember the friends around\nyou, who centre all their hopes in you."

Their chief had suspected\nManfred of being privy to the Princess\u2019s absconding, and this insult from\na man, who he concluded was stationed by that Prince to secrete her,\nconfirming his suspicions, he made no reply, but discharging a blow with\nhis sabre at Theodore, would soon have removed all obstruction, if\nTheodore, who took him for one of Manfred\u2019s captains, and who had no\nsooner given the provocation than prepared to support it, had not\nreceived the stroke on his shield. The valour that had so long been\nsmothered in his breast broke forth at once; he rushed impetuously on the\nKnight, whose pride and wrath were not less powerful incentives to hardy\ndeeds. The combat was furious, but not long. Theodore wounded the\nKnight in three several places, and at last disarmed him as he fainted by\nthe loss of blood.\n\nThe peasant, who had fled on the first onset, had given the alarm to some\nof Manfred\u2019s domestics, who, by his orders, were dispersed through the\nforest in pursuit of Isabella. They came up as the Knight fell, whom\nthey soon discovered to be the noble stranger. Theodore, notwithstanding\nhis hatred to Manfred, could not behold the victory he had gained without\nemotions of pity and generosity. But he was more touched when he learned\nthe quality of his adversary, and was informed that he was no retainer,\nbut an enemy, of Manfred. He assisted the servants of the latter in\ndisarming the Knight, and in endeavouring to stanch the blood that flowed\nfrom his wounds."

I am the more willing to\ncomply, because I shall thus give a general answer to the question, so\nvery frequently asked me--\"How I, when a young girl, came to think of,\nand to dilate upon, so very hideous an idea?\" It is true that I am very\naverse to bringing myself forward in print; but as my account will only\nappear as an appendage to a former production, and as it will be\nconfined to such topics as have connection with my authorship alone, I\ncan scarcely accuse myself of a personal intrusion.\n\nIt is not singular that, as the daughter of two persons of distinguished\nliterary celebrity, I should very early in life have thought of writing.\nAs a child I scribbled; and my favourite pastime, during the hours given\nme for recreation, was to \"write stories.\" Still I had a dearer pleasure\nthan this, which was the formation of castles in the air--the indulging\nin waking dreams--the following up trains of thought, which had for\ntheir subject the formation of a succession of imaginary incidents. My\ndreams were at once more fantastic and agreeable than my writings."

Resolved to pursue no inglorious\ncareer, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording scope for his\nspirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanscrit languages\nengaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same\nstudies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I wished to\nfly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great relief in\nbeing the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction\nbut consolation in the works of the orientalists.

No sooner\ndid that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its\ntruth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for\nsupport. The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom.\nNothing in human shape could have destroyed that fair child. _He_ was\nthe murderer! I could not doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an\nirresistible proof of the fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it\nwould have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging\namong the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Sal\u00eave, a\nhill that bounds Plainpalais on the south. He soon reached the summit,\nand disappeared.\n\nI remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued,\nand the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I revolved in\nmy mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole\ntrain of my progress towards the creation; the appearance of the work of\nmy own hands alive at my bedside; its departure."

The work\nwas soon finished: in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me\nand my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice, that\nwas continually lessening, and thus preparing for me a hideous death.\n\nIn this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died; and\nI myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress, when I\nsaw your vessel riding at anchor, and holding forth to me hopes of\nsuccour and life. I had no conception that vessels ever came so far\nnorth, and was astounded at the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my\nsledge to construct oars; and by these means was enabled, with infinite\nfatigue, to move my ice-raft in the direction of your ship. I had\ndetermined, if you were going southward, still to trust myself to the\nmercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose."

I never saw a more\ninteresting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness,\nand even madness; but there are moments when, if any one performs an act\nof kindness towards him, or does him any the most trifling service, his\nwhole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence\nand sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy\nand despairing; and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of\nthe weight of woes that oppresses him.\n\nWhen my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off\nthe men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not\nallow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body\nand mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once,\nhowever, the lieutenant asked, Why he had come so far upon the ice in so\nstrange a vehicle?\n\nHis countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom; and he\nreplied, \"To seek one who fled from me.\"\n\n\"And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then I fancy we have seen him; for the day before we picked you up, we\nsaw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.\"\n\nThis aroused the stranger's attention; and he asked a multitude of\nquestions concerning the route which the d\u00e6mon, as he called him, had\npursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said,--\"I have,\ndoubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people;\nbut you are too considerate to make enquiries.\"\n\n\"Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to\ntrouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine."

Mont Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont\nBlanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_, and its\ntremendous _d\u00f4me_ overlooked the valley.\n\nA tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this\njourney. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and\nrecognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing\naccents, and maternal nature bade me weep no more."

My father still desired to delay our departure, fearful\nthat I could not sustain the fatigues of a journey: for I was a\nshattered wreck,--the shadow of a human being. My strength was gone. I\nwas a mere skeleton; and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted\nframe.\n\nStill, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and\nimpatience, my father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on\nboard a vessel bound for Havre-de-Grace, and sailed with a fair wind\nfrom the Irish shores. It was midnight. I lay on the deck, looking at\nthe stars, and listening to the dashing of the waves. I hailed the\ndarkness that shut Ireland from my sight; and my pulse beat with a\nfeverish joy when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva. The past\nappeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in\nwhich I was, the wind that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland,\nand the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly that I was\ndeceived by no vision, and that Clerval, my friend and dearest\ncompanion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I\nrepassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing\nwith my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for\nIngolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me\non to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night\nin which he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a\nthousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.\n\nEver since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of\ntaking every night a small quantity of laudanum; for it was by means of\nthis drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the\npreservation of life."

The infant had been\nplaced with these good people to nurse: they were better off then. They\nhad not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born. The\nfather of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of\nthe antique glory of Italy,--one among the _schiavi ognor frementi_, who\nexerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the\nvictim of its weakness. Whether he had died, or still lingered in the\ndungeons of Austria, was not known. His property was confiscated, his\nchild became an orphan and a beggar. She continued with her foster\nparents, and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a garden rose\namong dark-leaved brambles.\n\nWhen my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall\nof our villa, a child fairer than pictured cherub--a creature who seemed\nto shed radiance from her looks, and whose form and motions were lighter\nthan the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With\nhis permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield\ntheir charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence\nhad seemed a blessing to them; but it would be unfair to her to keep her\nin poverty and want, when Providence afforded her such powerful\nprotection. They consulted their village priest, and the result was,\nthat Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents' house--my more\nthan sister--the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations\nand my pleasures."

    "output": " I learned\nalso the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth and his companion\nhad each of them several names, but the old man had only one, which was\n_father_. The girl was called _sister_, or _Agatha_; and the youth\n_Felix_, _brother_, or _son_. I cannot describe the delight I felt when\nI learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds, and was able\nto pronounce them. I distinguished several other words, without being\nable as yet to understand or apply them; such as _good_, _dearest_,\n_unhappy_.\n\n\"I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of the\ncottagers greatly endeared them to me: when they were unhappy, I felt\ndepressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw few\nhuman beings beside them; and if any other happened to enter the\ncottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the\nsuperior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive,\noften endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that\nhe called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a\ncheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure\neven upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled\nwith tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I\ngenerally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after\nhaving listened to the exhortations of her father."
