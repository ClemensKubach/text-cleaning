    "0": "INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nThe Publishers of the Standard Novels, in selecting \"Frankenstein\" for\none of their series, expressed a wish that I should furnish them with\nsome account of the origin of the story. I am the more willing to\ncomply, because I shall thus give a general answer to the question, so\nvery frequently asked me--\"How I, when a young girl, came to think of,\nand to dilate upon, so very hideous an idea?\" It is true that I am very\naverse to bringing myself forward in print; but as my account will only\nappear as an appendage to a former production, and as it will be\nconfined to such topics as have connection with my authorship alone, I\ncan scarcely accuse myself of a personal intrusion.\n\nIt is not singular that, as the daughter of two persons of distinguished\nliterary celebrity, I should very early in life have thought of writing.\nAs a child I scribbled; and my favourite pastime, during the hours given\nme for recreation, was to \"write stories.\" Still I had a dearer pleasure\nthan this, which was the formation of castles in the air--the indulging\nin waking dreams--the following up trains of thought, which had for\ntheir subject the formation of a succession of imaginary incidents. My\ndreams were at once more fantastic and agreeable than my writings.",
    "1": " In\nthe latter I was a close imitator--rather doing as others had done,\nthan putting down the suggestions of my own mind. What I wrote was\nintended at least for one other eye--my childhood's companion and\nfriend; but my dreams were all my own; I accounted for them to nobody;\nthey were my refuge when annoyed--my dearest pleasure when free.\n\nI lived principally in the country as a girl, and passed a considerable\ntime in Scotland. I made occasional visits to the more picturesque\nparts; but my habitual residence was on the blank and dreary northern\nshores of the Tay, near Dundee. Blank and dreary on retrospection I call\nthem; they were not so to me then. They were the eyry of freedom, and\nthe pleasant region where unheeded I could commune with the creatures of\nmy fancy. I wrote then--but in a most common-place style. It was beneath\nthe trees of the grounds belonging to our house, or on the bleak sides\nof the woodless mountains near, that my true compositions, the airy\nflights of my imagination, were born and fostered. I did not make myself\nthe heroine of my tales.",
    "2": " Life appeared to me too common-place an affair\nas regarded myself. I could not figure to myself that romantic woes or\nwonderful events would ever be my lot; but I was not confined to my own\nidentity, and I could people the hours with creations far more\ninteresting to me at that age, than my own sensations.\n\nAfter this my life became busier, and reality stood in place of fiction.\nMy husband, however, was from the first, very anxious that I should\nprove myself worthy of my parentage, and enrol myself on the page of\nfame. He was for ever inciting me to obtain literary reputation, which\neven on my own part I cared for then, though since I have become\ninfinitely indifferent to it. At this time he desired that I should\nwrite, not so much with the idea that I could produce any thing worthy\nof notice, but that he might himself judge how far I possessed the\npromise of better things hereafter. Still I did nothing. Travelling, and\nthe cares of a family, occupied my time; and study, in the way of\nreading, or improving my ideas in communication with his far more\ncultivated mind, was all of literary employment that engaged my\nattention.\n\nIn the summer of 1816, we visited Switzerland, and became the neighbours\nof Lord Byron. At first we spent our pleasant hours on the lake, or\nwandering on its shores; and Lord Byron, who was writing the third canto\nof Childe Harold, was the only one among us who put his thoughts upon\npaper. These, as he brought them successively to us, clothed in all the\nlight and harmony of poetry, seemed to stamp as divine the glories of\nheaven and earth, whose influences we partook with him.",
    "3": "\n\nBut it proved a wet, ungenial summer, and incessant rain often confined\nus for days to the house. Some volumes of ghost stories, translated from\nthe German into French, fell into our hands. There was the History of\nthe Inconstant Lover, who, when he thought to clasp the bride to whom he\nhad pledged his vows, found himself in the arms of the pale ghost of her\nwhom he had deserted. There was the tale of the sinful founder of his\nrace, whose miserable doom it was to bestow the kiss of death on all the\nyounger sons of his fated house, just when they reached the age of\npromise. His gigantic, shadowy form, clothed like the ghost in Hamlet,\nin complete armour, but with the beaver up, was seen at midnight, by\nthe moon's fitful beams, to advance slowly along the gloomy avenue. The\nshape was lost beneath the shadow of the castle walls; but soon a gate\nswung back, a step was heard, the door of the chamber opened, and he\nadvanced to the couch of the blooming youths, cradled in healthy sleep.\nEternal sorrow sat upon his face as he bent down and kissed the forehead\nof the boys, who from that hour withered like flowers snapt upon the\nstalk. I have not seen these stories since then; but their incidents are\nas fresh in my mind as if I had read them yesterday.\n\n\"We will each write a ghost story,\" said Lord Byron; and his proposition\nwas acceded to. There were four of us. The noble author began a tale, a\nfragment of which he printed at the end of his poem of Mazeppa.",
    "4": " Shelley,\nmore apt to embody ideas and sentiments in the radiance of brilliant\nimagery, and in the music of the most melodious verse that adorns our\nlanguage, than to invent the machinery of a story, commenced one founded\non the experiences of his early life. Poor Polidori had some terrible\nidea about a skull-headed lady, who was so punished for peeping through\na key-hole--what to see I forget--something very shocking and wrong of\ncourse; but when she was reduced to a worse condition than the renowned\nTom of Coventry, he did not know what to do with her, and was obliged to\ndespatch her to the tomb of the Capulets, the only place for which she\nwas fitted. The illustrious poets also, annoyed by the platitude of\nprose, speedily relinquished their uncongenial task.\n\nI busied myself _to think of a story_,--a story to rival those which had\nexcited us to this task. One which would speak to the mysterious fears\nof our nature, and awaken thrilling horror--one to make the reader dread\nto look round, to curdle the blood, and quicken the beatings of the\nheart. If I did not accomplish these things, my ghost story would be\nunworthy of its name. I thought and pondered--vainly. I felt that blank\nincapability of invention which is the greatest misery of authorship,\nwhen dull Nothing replies to our anxious invocations. _Have you thought\nof a story?_ I was asked each morning, and each morning I was forced to\nreply with a mortifying negative.",
    "5": "\n\nEvery thing must have a beginning, to speak in Sanchean phrase; and that\nbeginning must be linked to something that went before. The Hindoos give\nthe world an elephant to support it, but they make the elephant stand\nupon a tortoise. Invention, it must be humbly admitted, does not consist\nin creating out of void, but out of chaos; the materials must, in the\nfirst place, be afforded: it can give form to dark, shapeless\nsubstances, but cannot bring into being the substance itself. In all\nmatters of discovery and invention, even of those that appertain to the\nimagination, we are continually reminded of the story of Columbus and\nhis egg. Invention consists in the capacity of seizing on the\ncapabilities of a subject, and in the power of moulding and fashioning\nideas suggested to it.\n\nMany and long were the conversations between Lord Byron and Shelley, to\nwhich I was a devout but nearly silent listener. During one of these,\nvarious philosophical doctrines were discussed, and among others the\nnature of the principle of life, and whether there was any probability\nof its ever being discovered and communicated. They talked of the\nexperiments of Dr. Darwin, (I speak not of what the Doctor really did,\nor said that he did, but, as more to my purpose, of",

Not thus, after all, would life be given. Perhaps a\ncorpse would be re-animated; galvanism had given token of such things:\nperhaps the component parts of a creature might be manufactured, brought\ntogether, and endued with vital warmth.\n\nNight waned upon this talk, and even the witching hour had gone by,\nbefore we retired to rest. When I placed my head on my pillow, I did not\nsleep, nor could I be said to think. My imagination, unbidden, possessed\nand guided me, gifting the successive images that arose in my mind with\na vividness far beyond the usual bounds of reverie. I saw--with shut\neyes, but acute mental vision,--I saw the pale student of unhallowed\narts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous\nphantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some\npowerful engine, show signs of life, and stir with an uneasy, half vital\nmotion. Frightful must it be; for supremely frightful would be the\neffect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism of the\nCreator of the world. His success would terrify the artist; he would\nrush away from his odious handywork, horror-stricken. He would hope\nthat, left to itself, the slight spark of life which he had communicated\nwould fade; that this thing, which had received such imperfect\nanimation, would subside into dead matter; and ",
    "7": "he might sleep in the\nbelief that the silence of the grave would quench for ever the transient\nexistence of the hideous corpse which he had looked upon as the cradle\nof life. He sleeps; but he is awakened; he opens his eyes; behold the\nhorrid thing stands at his bedside, opening his curtains, and looking on\nhim with yellow, watery, but speculative eyes.\n\nI opened mine in terror. The idea so possessed my mind, that a thrill of\nfear ran through me, and I wished to exchange the ghastly image of my\nfancy for the realities around. I see them still; the very room, the\ndark _parquet_, the closed shutters, with the moonlight struggling\nthrough, and the sense I had that the glassy lake and white high Alps\nwere beyond. I could not so easily get rid of my hideous phantom; still\nit haunted me. I must try to think of something else. I recurred to my\nghost story,--my tiresome unlucky ghost story! O! if I could only\ncontrive one which would frighten my reader as I myself had been\nfrightened that night!\n\nSwift as light and as cheering was the idea that broke in upon me. \"I\nhave found it! What terrified me will terrify others; and I need only\ndescribe the spectre which had haunted my midnight pillow.\" On the\nmorrow I announced that I had _thought of a story_. I began that day\nwith the words, _It was on a dreary night of November_, making only a\ntranscript of the grim terrors of my waking dream.\n\nAt first I thought but of a few pages--of a short tale; but Shelley\nurged me to develope the idea at greater length. I certainly did not owe\nthe suggestion of one incident, nor scarcely of one train of feeling, to\nmy husband, and yet but for his incitement, it would never have taken\nthe form in which it was presented to the world. From this declaration I\nmust except the preface. As far as I can recollect, it was entirely\nwritten by him.\n\nAnd now, once again, I bid my hideous progeny go forth and prosper. I\nhave an affection for it, for it was the offspring of happy days, when\ndeath and grief were but words, which found no true echo in my heart.",
    "8": "\nIts several pages speak of many a walk, many a drive, and many a\nconversation, when I was not alone; and my companion was one who, in\nthis world, I shall never see more. But this is for myself; my readers\nhave nothing to do with these associations.\n\nI will add but one word as to the alterations I have made. They are\nprincipally those of style. I have changed no portion of the story, nor\nintroduced any new ideas or circumstances. I have mended the language\nwhere it was so bald as to interfere with the interest of the narrative;\nand these changes occur almost exclusively in the beginning of the first\nvolume. Throughout they are entirely confined to such parts as are mere\nadjuncts to the story, leaving the core and substance of it untouched.\n\nM. W. S.\n\n_London, October 15, 1831._\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE.\n\n\nThe event on which this fiction is founded, has been supposed, by Dr.\nDarwin, and some of the physiological writers of Germany, as not of\nimpossible occurrence. I shall not be supposed as according the remotest\ndegree of serious faith to such an imagination; yet, in assuming it as\nthe basis of a work of fancy, I have not considered myself as merely\nweaving a series of supernatural terrors.

The Iliad, the tragic poetry of Greece,--Shakspeare,\nin the Tempest, and Midsummer Night's Dream,--and most especially\nMilton, in Paradise Lost, conform to this rule; and the most humble\nnovelist, who seeks to confer or receive amusement from his labours,\nmay, without presumption, apply to prose fiction a licence, or rather a\nrule, from the adoption of which so many exquisite combinations of human\nfeeling have resulted in the highest specimens of poetry.\n\nThe circumstance on which my story rests was suggested in casual\nconversation. It was commenced partly as a source of amusement, and\npartly as an expedient for exercising any untried resources of mind.\nOther motives were mingled with these, as the work proceeded.",
    "10": " I am by\nno means indifferent to the manner in which whatever moral tendencies\nexist in the sentiments or characters it contains shall affect the\nreader; yet my chief concern in this respect has been limited to the\navoiding the enervating effects of the novels of the present day, and to\nthe exhibition of the amiableness of domestic affection, and the\nexcellence of universal virtue. The opinions which naturally spring from\nthe character and situation of the hero are by no means to be conceived\nas existing always in my own conviction; nor is any inference justly to\nbe drawn from the following pages as prejudicing any philosophical\ndoctrine of whatever kind.\n\nIt is a subject also of additional interest to the author, that this\nstory was begun in the majestic region where the scene is principally\nlaid, and in society which cannot cease to be regretted. I passed the\nsummer of 1816 in the environs of Geneva. The season was cold and rainy,\nand in the evenings we crowded around a blazing wood fire, and\noccasionally amused ourselves with some German stories of ghosts, which\nhappened to fall into our hands. These tales excited in us a playful\ndesire of imitation. Two other friends (a tale from the pen of one of\nwhom would be far more acceptable to the public than any thing I can\never hope to produce) and myself agreed to write each a story, founded\non some supernatural occurrence.\n\nThe weather, however, suddenly became serene; and my two friends left me\non a journey among the Alps, and lost, in the magnificent scenes which\nthey present, all memory of their ghostly visions. The following tale is\nthe only one which has been completed.\n\nMarlow, September, 1817.\n\n\n\n\nFRANKENSTEIN;\n\nOR,\n\nTHE MODERN PROMETHEUS.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER I.\n\n\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\n\nSt. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17--.\n\nYou will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the\ncommencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil\nforebodings.",
    "11": " I arrived here yesterday; and my first task is to assure my\ndear sister of my welfare, and increasing confidence in the success of\nmy undertaking.\n\nI am already far north of London; and as I walk in the streets of\nPetersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which\nbraces my nerves, and fills me with delight. Do you understand this\nfeeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which\nI am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by\nthis wind of promise, my day dreams become more fervent and vivid. I try\nin vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and\ndesolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of\nbeauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible; its\nbroad disk just skirting the horizon, and diffusing a perpetual\nsplendour. There--for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust\nin preceding navigators--there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing\nover a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in\nbeauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe. Its\nproductions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of\nthe heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes.",
    "12": "\nWhat may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may there\ndiscover the wondrous power which attracts the needle; and may regulate\na thousand celestial observations, that require only this voyage to\nrender their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate\nmy ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before\nvisited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man.\nThese are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of\ndanger or death, and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with\nthe joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday\nmates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river. But, supposing\nall these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable\nbenefit which I shall confer on all mankind to the last generation, by\ndiscovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which\nat present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret\nof the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an\nundertaking such as mine.\n\nThese reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my\nletter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to\nheaven; for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a\nsteady purpose,--a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye.",
    "13": "\nThis expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I have\nread with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been\nmade in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the\nseas which surround the pole. You may remember, that a history of all\nthe voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our\ngood uncle Thomas's library. My education was neglected, yet I was\npassionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and night,\nand my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as\na child, on learning that my father's dying injunction had forbidden my\nuncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.\n\nThese visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets\nwhose effusions entranced my soul, and lifted it to heaven. I also\nbecame a poet, and for one year lived in a Paradise of my own creation;\nI imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the\nnames of Homer and Shakspeare are consecrated. You are well acquainted\nwith my failure, and how heavily I bore the disappointment. But just at\nthat time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were\nturned into the channel of their earlier bent.\n\nSix years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can,\neven now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great\nenterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied\nthe whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily\nendured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder\nthan the common sailors during the day, and devoted my nights to the\nstudy of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of\nphysical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest\npractical advantage.",
    "14": " Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a\nGreenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I must own I felt\na little proud, when my captain offered me the second dignity in the\nvessel, and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness; so\nvaluable did he consider my services.\n\nAnd now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great\npurpose? My life might have been passed in ease and luxury; but I\npreferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh,\nthat some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage\nand my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are\noften depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage,\nthe emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not\nonly to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own,\nwhen theirs are failing.\n\nThis is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly\nquickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in\nmy opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stage-coach. The\ncold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs,--a dress which I\nhave already adopted; for there is a great difference between walking\nthe deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise\nprevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no\nambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and\nArchangel.\n\nI shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\nintention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying\nthe insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think\nnecessary among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing.",
    "15": " I do not\nintend to sail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah,\ndear sister, how can I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many\nmonths, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail,\nyou will see me again soon, or never.\n\nFarewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on\nyou, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for\nall your love and kindness.\n\nYour affectionate brother,\n\nR. WALTON.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER II.\n\n\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\n\nArchangel, 28th March, 17--.\n\nHow slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!\nyet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel,\nand am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already\nengaged, appear to be men on whom I can depend, and are certainly\npossessed of dauntless courage.\n\nBut I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy; and the\nabsence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil. I have\nno friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success,\nthere will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by\ndisappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection.",
    "16": " I\nshall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium\nfor the communication of feeling. I desire the company of a man who\ncould sympathise with me; whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem\nme romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I\nhave no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as\nwell as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or\namend my plans. How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor\nbrother! I am too ardent in execution, and too impatient of\ndifficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am\nself-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a\ncommon, and read nothing but our uncle Thomas's books of voyages. At\nthat age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own\ncountry; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive\nits most important benefits from such a conviction, that I perceived the\nnecessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my\nnative country. Now I am twenty-eight, and am in reality more illiterate\nthan many schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more,\nand that my day dreams are more extended and magnificent; but they want\n(as the painters call it) _keeping_; and I greatly need a friend who\nwould have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection\nenough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.",
    "17": "\n\nWell, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on\nthe wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen.\nYet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in\nthese rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful\ncourage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory: or rather, to\nword my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his\nprofession. He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and\nprofessional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the\nnoblest endowments of humanity. I first became acquainted with him on\nboard a whale vessel: finding that he was unemployed in this city, I\neasily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.\n\nThe master is a person of an excellent disposition, and is remarkable in\nthe ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This\ncircumstance, added to his well known integrity and dauntless courage,\nmade me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best\nyears spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the\ngroundwork of my character, that I cannot overcome an intense distaste\nto the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it\nto be necessary; and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his\nkindliness of heart, and the respect and obedience paid to him by his\ncrew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his\nservices. I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady\nwho owes to him the happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story.\nSome years ago, he loved a young Russian lady, of moderate fortune; and\nhaving amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl\nconsented to the match.",
    "18": " He saw his mistress once before the destined\nceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and, throwing herself at his\nfeet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she\nloved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never\nconsent to the union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on\nbeing informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his\npursuit. He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had\ndesigned to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on\nhis rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase\nstock, and then himself solicited the young woman's father to consent to\nher marriage with her lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking\nhimself bound in honour to my friend; who, when he found the father\ninexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his\nformer mistress was married according to her inclinations. \"What a noble\nfellow!\" you will exclaim.",
    "19": " He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated:\nhe is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends\nhim, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts\nfrom the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.\n\nYet do not suppose, because I complain a little, or because I can\nconceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am\nwavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate; and my voyage is\nonly now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The\nwinter has been dreadfully severe; but the spring promises well, and it\nis considered as a remarkably early season; so that perhaps I may sail\nsooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me\nsufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness, whenever the\nsafety of others is committed to my care.\n\nI cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my\nundertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the\ntrembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am\npreparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to \"the land of\nmist and snow\"; but I shall kill no albatross, therefore do not be\nalarmed for my safety, or if I should come back to you as worn and woful\nas the \"Ancient Mariner\"? You will smile at my allusion; but I will\ndisclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my\npassionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean, to that\nproduction of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something\nat work in my soul, which I do not understand. I am practically\nindustrious--pains-taking;--a workman to execute with perseverance and\nlabour:--but besides this, there is a love for the marvellous, a belief\nin the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out\nof the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited\nregions I am about to explore.",
    "20": "\n\nBut to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after\nhaving traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of\nAfrica or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to\nlook on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to\nme by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions\nwhen I need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly.\nRemember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.\n\nYour affectionate brother,\n\nROBERT WALTON.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER III.\n\n\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\n\nMY DEAR SISTER, July 7th, 17--.\n\nI write a few lines in haste, to say that I am safe, and well advanced\non my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on its\nhomeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see\nmy native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good spirits:\nmy men are bold, and apparently firm of purpose; nor do the floating\nsheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers of the\nregion towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We have\nalready reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of summer,\nand although not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which blow\nus speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain,\nbreathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected.",
    "21": "\n\nNo incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a\nletter. One or two stiff gales, and the springing of a leak, are\naccidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record; and\nI shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.\n\nAdieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured, that for my own sake, as well as\nyours, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool, persevering,\nand prudent.\n\nBut success _shall_ crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I have\ngone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas: the very stars\nthemselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not still\nproceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the\ndetermined heart and resolved will of man?\n\nMy swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must\nfinish. Heaven bless my beloved sister!\n\nR. W.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER IV.\n\n\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\n\nAugust 5th, 17--.\n\nSo strange an accident has happened to us, that I cannot forbear\nrecording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before\nthese papers can come into your possession.\n\nLast Monday (July 31st), we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed\nin the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she\nfloated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were\ncompassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that\nsome change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.\n\nAbout two o'clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in\nevery direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have\nno end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow\nwatchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted\nour attention, and diverted our solicitude from our own situation. We\nperceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on\ntowards the north, at the distance of half a mile: ",
    "22": "a being which had the\nshape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge,\nand guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with\nour telescopes, until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the\nice.\n\nThis appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,\nmany hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote\nthat it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in,\nhowever, by ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had\nobserved with the greatest attention.\n\nAbout two hours after this occurrence, we heard the ground sea; and\nbefore night the ice broke, and freed our ship. We, however, lay to\nuntil the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose\nmasses which float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited\nof this time to rest for a few hours.\n\nIn the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck, and\nfound all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking\nto some one in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen\nbefore, which had drifted towards us in the night, on a large fragment\nof ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within\nit, whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.",
    "23": " He was not, as\nthe other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some\nundiscovered island, but an European. When I appeared on deck, the\nmaster said, \"Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish\non the open sea.\"\n\nOn perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a\nforeign accent. \"Before I come on board your vessel,\" said he, \"will\nyou have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?\"\n\nYou may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to\nme from a man on the brink of destruction, and to whom I should have\nsupposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not\nhave exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I\nreplied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the\nnorthern pole.\n\nUpon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to come on board.\nGood God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his\nsafety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were nearly\nfrozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I\nnever saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him\ninto the cabin; but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted.\nWe accordingly brought him back to the deck, and restored him to\nanimation by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing him to swallow a small\nquantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in\nblankets, and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove. By slow\ndegrees he recovered, and ate a little soup, which restored him\nwonderfully.",
    "24": "\n\nTwo days passed in this manner before he was able to speak; and I often\nfeared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he\nhad in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin, and\nattended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more\ninteresting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness,\nand even madness; but there are moments when, if any one performs an act\nof kindness towards him, or does him any the most trifling service, his\nwhole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence\nand sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy\nand despairing; and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of\nthe weight of woes that oppresses him.\n\nWhen my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off\nthe men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not\nallow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body\nand mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once,\nhowever, the lieutenant asked, Why he had come so far upon the ice in so\nstrange a vehicle?\n\nHis countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom; and he\nreplied, \"To seek one who fled from me.\"\n\n\"And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then I fancy we have seen him; for the day before we picked you up, we\nsaw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.\"\n\nThis aroused the stranger's attention; and he asked a multitude of\nquestions concerning the route which the d\u00e6mon, as he called him, had\npursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said,--\"I have,\ndoubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people;\nbut you are too considerate to make enquiries.\"\n\n\"Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to\ntrouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.",
    "25": "\"\n\n\"And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have\nbenevolently restored me to life.\"\n\nSoon after this he enquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice\nhad destroyed the other sledge? I replied, that I could not answer with\nany degree of certainty; for the ice had not broken until near midnight,\nand the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that\ntime; but of this I could not judge.\n\nFrom this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the\nstranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck, to watch\nfor the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to\nremain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of\nthe atmosphere. I have promised that some one should watch for him, and\ngive him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.\n\nSuch is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the\npresent day. The stranger has gradually improved in health, but is very\nsilent, and appears uneasy when any one except myself enters his cabin.\nYet his manners are so conciliating and gentle, that the sailors are all\ninterested in him, although they have had very little communication with\nhim. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother; and his constant\nand deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must have been\na noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck so\nattractive and amiable.\n\nI said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no\nfriend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit\nhad been broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as\nthe brother of my heart.",
    "26": "\n\nI shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should\nI have any fresh incidents to record.\n\n\nAugust 13th, 17--.\n\nMy affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my\nadmiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble\na creature destroyed by misery, without feeling the most poignant grief?\nHe is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated; and when he\nspeaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they\nflow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.\n\nHe is now much recovered from his illness, and is continually on the\ndeck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet,\nalthough unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery, but\nthat he interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has\nfrequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him\nwithout disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour\nof my eventual success, and into every minute detail of the measures I\nhad taken to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he\nevinced, to use the language of my heart; to give utterance to the\nburning ardour of my soul; and to say, with all the fervour that warmed\nme, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every\nhope, to the furtherance of my enterprise. One man's life or death were\nbut a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I\nsought; for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the\nelemental foes of our race.",
    "27": " As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my\nlistener's countenance. At first I perceived that he tried to suppress\nhis emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes; and my voice quivered\nand failed me, as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his\nfingers,--a groan burst from his heaving breast. I paused;--at length he\nspoke, in broken accents:--\"Unhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have\nyou drank also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me,--let me reveal my\ntale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!\"\n\nSuch words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the\nparoxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened\npowers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were\nnecessary to restore his composure.\n\nHaving conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise\nhimself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of\ndespair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He\nasked me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told:\nbut it awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of\nfinding a friend--of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a\nfellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot; and expressed my conviction\nthat a man could boast of little happiness, who did not enjoy this\nblessing.",
    "28": "\n\n\"I agree with you,\" replied the stranger; \"we are unfashioned creatures,\nbut half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves--such a\nfriend ought to be--do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and\nfaulty natures. I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures,\nand am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship. You have\nhope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair. But I--I\nhave lost every thing, and cannot begin life anew.\"\n\nAs he said this, his countenance became expressive of a calm settled\ngrief, that touched me to the heart. But he was silent, and presently\nretired to his cabin.\n\nEven broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does\nthe beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight\nafforded by these wonderful regions, seems still to have the power of\nelevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he may\nsuffer misery, and be overwhelmed by disappointments; yet, when he has\nretired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit, that has a\nhalo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.\n\nWill you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine\nwanderer? You would not, if you saw him. You have been tutored and\nrefined by books and retirement from the world, and you are, therefore,\nsomewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to\nappreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I\nhave endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses, that\nelevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. I\nbelieve it to be an intuitive discernment; a quick but never-failing\npower of judgment; a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled\nfor clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression, and a\nvoice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.",
    "29": "\n\n\nAugust 19. 17--.\n\nYesterday the stranger said to me, \"You may easily perceive, Captain\nWalton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had\ndetermined, at one time, that the memory of these evils should die with\nme; but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for\nknowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the\ngratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine\nhas been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful\nto you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course,\nexposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am,\nI imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale; one that may\ndirect you if you succeed in your undertaking, and console you in case\nof failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed\nmarvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature, I might fear to\nencounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will\nappear possible in these wild and mysterious regions, which would\nprovoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers\nof nature:--nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series\ninternal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.\"\n\nYou may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered\ncommunication; yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by\na recital of his misfortunes.",
    "30": " I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the\npromised narrative, partly from curiosity, and partly from a strong\ndesire to ameliorate his fate, if it were in my power. I expressed these\nfeelings in my answer.\n\n\"I thank you,\" he replied, \"for your sympathy, but it is useless; my\nfate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall\nrepose in peace. I understand your feeling,\" continued he, perceiving\nthat I wished to interrupt him; \"but you are mistaken, my friend, if\nthus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny: listen\nto my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined.\"\n\nHe then told me, that he would commence his narrative the next day when\nI should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I\nhave resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my\nduties, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has\nrelated during the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make\nnotes. This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure:\nbut to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own lips, with what\ninterest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I\ncommence my task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous\neyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin\nhand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his face are\nirradiated by the soul within. Strange and harrowing must be his story;\nfrightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course, and\nwrecked it--thus!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.",
    "31": "\n\n\nI am by birth a Genevese; and my family is one of the most distinguished\nof that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and\nsyndics; and my father had filled several public situations with honour\nand reputation. He was respected by all who knew him, for his integrity\nand indefatigable attention to public business. He passed his younger\ndays perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of\ncircumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until the\ndecline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family.\n\nAs the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot\nrefrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a\nmerchant, who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous\nmischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a\nproud and unbending disposition, and could not bear to live in poverty\nand oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been\ndistinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,\ntherefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter\nto the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My\nfather loved Beaufort with the truest friendship, and was deeply grieved\nby his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He bitterly deplored\nthe false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of\nthe affection that united them. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek\nhim out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again\nthrough his credit and assistance.\n\nBeaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself; and it was ten\nmonths before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this\ndiscovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean\nstreet, near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone\nwelcomed him.",
    "32": " Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the\nwreck of his fortunes; but it was sufficient to provide him with\nsustenance for some months, and in the mean time he hoped to procure\nsome respectable employment in a merchant's house. The interval was,\nconsequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and\nrankling, when he had leisure for reflection; and at length it took so\nfast hold of his mind, that at the end of three months he lay on a bed\nof sickness, incapable of any exertion.\n\nHis daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness; but she saw with\ndespair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing, and that there\nwas no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind\nof an uncommon mould; and her courage rose to support her in her\nadversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw; and by various\nmeans contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.\n\nSeveral months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time\nwas more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence\ndecreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving\nher an orphan and a beggar.",
    "33": " This last blow overcame her; and she knelt\nby Beaufort's coffin, weeping bitterly, when my father entered the\nchamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who\ncommitted herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend, he\nconducted her to Geneva, and placed her under the protection of a\nrelation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.\n\nThere was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but\nthis circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted\naffection. There was a sense of justice in my father's upright mind,\nwhich rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love\nstrongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the\nlate-discovered unworthiness of one beloved, and so was disposed to set\na greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and\nworship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the\ndoating fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her\nvirtues, and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\nher for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace\nto his behaviour to her. Every thing was made to yield to her wishes and\nher convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered\nby the gardener, from every rougher wind, and to surround her with all\nthat could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent\nmind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant\nspirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two\nyears that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had\ngradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after\ntheir union they sought the",
    "34": " pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of\nscene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as\na restorative for her weakened frame.\n\nFrom Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was\nborn at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I\nremained for several years their only child. Much as they were attached\nto each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection\nfrom a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother's tender\ncaresses, and my father's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding\nme, are my first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol,\nand something better--their child, the innocent and helpless creature\nbestowed on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future\nlot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as\nthey fulfilled their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of\nwhat they owed towards the being to which they had given life, added to\nthe active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined\nthat while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of\npatience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken\ncord, that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me.",
    "35": "\n\nFor a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to\nhave a daughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was\nabout five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of\nItaly, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their\nbenevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor.\nThis, to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a\npassion,--remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been\nrelieved,--for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the\nafflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a\nvale attracted their notice, as being singularly disconsolate, while the\nnumber of half-clothed children gathered about it, spoke of penury in\nits worst shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan,\nmy mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant\nand his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a\nscanty meal to five hungry babes. Among these there was one which\nattracted my mother far above all the rest. She appeared of a different\nstock. The four others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child\nwas thin, and very fair. Her hair was the brightest living gold, and,\ndespite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of\ndistinction on her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes\ncloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of\nsensibility and sweetness, that none could behold her without looking on\nher as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent, and bearing a\ncelestial stamp in all her features.",
    "36": "\n\nThe peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and\nadmiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She\nwas not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother\nwas a German, and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been\nplaced with these good people to nurse: they were better off then. They\nhad not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born. The\nfather of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of\nthe antique glory of Italy,--one among the _schiavi ognor frementi_, who\nexerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the\nvictim of its weakness. Whether he had died, or still lingered in the\ndungeons of Austria, was not known. His property was confiscated, his\nchild became an orphan and a beggar. She continued with her foster\nparents, and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a garden rose\namong dark-leaved brambles.\n\nWhen my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall\nof our villa, a child fairer than pictured cherub--a creature who seemed\nto shed radiance from her looks, and whose form and motions were lighter\nthan the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With\nhis permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield\ntheir charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence\nhad seemed a blessing to them; but it would be unfair to her to keep her\nin poverty and want, when Providence afforded her such powerful\nprotection. They consulted their village priest, and the result was,\nthat Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents' house--my more\nthan sister--the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations\nand my pleasures.",
    "37": "\n\nEvery one loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential\nattachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my\npride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to my\nhome, my mother had said playfully,--\"I have a pretty present for my\nVictor--to-morrow he shall have it.\" And when, on the morrow, she\npresented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish\nseriousness, interpreted her words literally, and looked upon Elizabeth\nas mine--mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on\nher, I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other\nfamiliarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body\nforth the kind of relation in which she stood to me--my more than\nsister, since till death she was to be mine only.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nWe were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in\nour ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of\ndisunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the\ndiversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer\ntogether. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition;\nbut, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense application,\nand was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. She busied\nherself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the\nmajestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home--the\nsublime shapes of the mountains; the changes of the seasons; tempest and\ncalm; the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine\nsummers,--she found ample scope for admiration and delight. While my\ncompanion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the\nmagnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their\ncauses. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.\nCuriosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness\nakin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest\nsensations I can remember.",
    "38": "\n\nOn the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave\nup entirely their wandering life, and fixed themselves in their native\ncountry. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,\nthe eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a\nleague from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the\nlives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my\ntemper to avoid a crowd, and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was\nindifferent, therefore, to my schoolfellows in general; but I united\nmyself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry\nClerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular\ntalent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger, for\nits own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He\ncomposed heroic songs, and began to write many a tale of enchantment and\nknightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays, and to enter into\nmasquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of\nRoncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous\ntrain who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands\nof the infidels.\n\nNo human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My\nparents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We\nfelt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their\ncaprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we\nenjoyed. When I mingled with other families, I distinctly discerned how\npeculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the developement\nof filial love.\n\nMy temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some\nlaw in my temperature they were turned, not towards childish pursuits,\nbut to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things\nindiscriminately.",
    "39": " I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor\nthe code of governments, nor the politics of various states, possessed\nattractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I\ndesired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things, or\nthe inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied\nme, still my enquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or, in its\nhighest sense, the physical secrets of the world.\n\nMeanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral\nrelations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and\nthe actions of men, were his theme; and his hope and his dream was to\nbecome one among those whose names are recorded in story, as the\ngallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul of\nElizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home. Her\nsympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her\ncelestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was the\nliving spirit of love to soften and attract: I might have become sullen\nin my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that she was\nthere to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness.",
    "40": " And\nClerval--could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?--yet\nhe might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his\ngenerosity--so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for\nadventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of\nbeneficence, and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring\nambition.\n\nI feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,\nbefore misfortune had tainted my mind, and changed its bright visions of\nextensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self.\nBesides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those\nevents which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery: for\nwhen I would account to myself for the birth of that passion, which\nafterwards ruled my destiny, I find it arise, like a mountain river,\nfrom ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it\nproceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away\nall my hopes and joys.\n\nNatural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,\ntherefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my\npredilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age, we all\nwent on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon: the inclemency of\nthe weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this\nhouse I chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa.",
    "41": " I\nopened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate, and\nthe wonderful facts which he relates, soon changed this feeling into\nenthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind; and, bounding with\njoy, I communicated my discovery to my father. My father looked\ncarelessly at the titlepage of my book, and said, \"Ah! Cornelius\nAgrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad\ntrash.\"\n\nIf, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to\nme, that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded, and that\na modern system of science had been introduced, which possessed much\ngreater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were\nchimerical, while those of the former were real and practical; under\nsuch circumstances, I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside, and\nhave contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with\ngreater ardour to my former studies. It is even possible, that the train\nof my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my\nruin. But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no\nmeans assured me that he was acquainted with its contents; and I\ncontinued to read with the greatest avidity.\n\nWhen I returned home, my first care was to procure the whole works of\nthis author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read\nand studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they\nappeared to me treasures known to few beside myself.",
    "42": " I have described\nmyself as always having been embued with a fervent longing to penetrate\nthe secrets of nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful\ndiscoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies\ndiscontented and unsatisfied. Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed\nthat he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and\nunexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of\nnatural philosophy with whom I was acquainted, appeared even to my boy's\napprehensions, as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.\n\nThe untaught peasant beheld the elements around him, and was acquainted\nwith their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little\nmore. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal\nlineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect,\nanatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in\ntheir secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I had\ngazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human\nbeings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I\nhad repined.\n\nBut here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and\nknew more. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became\ntheir disciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the\neighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of education in the\nschools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self taught with regard to\nmy favourite studies.",
    "43": " My father was not scientific, and I was left to\nstruggle with a child's blindness, added to a student's thirst for\nknowledge. Under the guidance of my new preceptors, I entered with the\ngreatest diligence into the search of the philosopher's stone and the\nelixir of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention.\nWealth was an inferior object; but what glory would attend the\ndiscovery, if I could banish disease from the human frame, and render\nman invulnerable to any but a violent death!\n\nNor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a\npromise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of\nwhich I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always\nunsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and\nmistake, than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus\nfor a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an\nunadept, a thousand contradictory theories, and floundering desperately\nin a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent\nimagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed the\ncurrent of my ideas.",
    "44": "\n\nWhen I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near\nBelrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunder-storm. It\nadvanced from behind the mountains of Jura; and the thunder burst at\nonce with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I\nremained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity\nand delight. As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of\nfire issue from an old and beautiful oak, which stood about twenty yards\nfrom our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had\ndisappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited\nit the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner.\nIt was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribands\nof wood. I never beheld any thing so utterly destroyed.\n\nBefore this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of\nelectricity.

It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be\nknown. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew\ndespicable. By one of those caprices of the mind, which we are perhaps\nmost subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations;\nset down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive\ncreation; and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science,\nwhich could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge. In\nthis mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics, and the branches\nof study appertaining to that science, as being built upon secure\nfoundations, and so worthy of my consideration.\n\nThus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments\nare we bound to prosperity or ruin.

It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with\ntheir prosecution, happiness with their disregard.\n\nIt was a strong effort of the spirit of good; but it was ineffectual.\nDestiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and\nterrible destruction.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nWhen I had attained the age of seventeen, my parents resolved that I\nshould become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had hitherto\nattended the schools of Geneva; but my father thought it necessary, for\nthe completion of my education, that I should be made acquainted with\nother customs than those of my native country. My departure was\ntherefore fixed at an early date; but, before the day resolved upon\ncould arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred--an omen, as it\nwere, of my future misery.\n\nElizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she\nwas in the greatest danger. During her illness, many arguments had been\nurged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had,\nat first, yielded to our entreaties; but when she heard that the life of\nher favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety.",
    "47": " She\nattended her sick bed,--her watchful attentions triumphed over the\nmalignity of the distemper,--Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences\nof this imprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my\nmother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming\nsymptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the\nworst event. On her death-bed the fortitude and benignity of this best\nof women did not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and\nmyself:--\"My children,\" she said, \"my firmest hopes of future happiness\nwere placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be\nthe consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my\nplace to my younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you;\nand, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all?\nBut these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign\nmyself cheerfully to death, and will indulge a hope of meeting you in\nanother world.\"\n\nShe died calmly; and her countenance expressed affection even in death.\nI need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by\nthat most irreparable evil; the void that presents itself to the soul;\nand the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so long\nbefore the mind can persuade itself that she, whom we saw every day, and\nwhose very existence appeared a part of our own, can have departed for\never--that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished,\nand the sound of a voice so familiar, and dear to the ear, can be\nhushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of the first\ndays; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then\nthe actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has not that\nrude hand rent away some dear connection? and why should I describe a\nsorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at length arrives,\nwhen grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that\nplays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not\nbanished.",
    "48": " My mother was dead, but we had still duties which we ought to\nperform; we must continue our course with the rest, and learn to think\nourselves fortunate, whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.\n\nMy departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,\nwas now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of\nsome weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,\nakin to death, of the house of mourning, and to rush into the thick of\nlife. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was\nunwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me; and, above\nall, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.\n\nShe indeed veiled her grief, and strove to act the comforter to us all.\nShe looked steadily on life, and assumed its duties with courage and\nzeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her\nuncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time, when\nshe recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us. She\nforgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.\n\nThe day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last\nevening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him\nto accompany me, and to become my fellow student; but in vain.",
    "49": " His\nfather was a narrow-minded trader, and saw idleness and ruin in the\naspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune of\nbeing debarred from a liberal education. He said little; but when he\nspoke, I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a\nrestrained but firm resolve, not to be chained to the miserable details\nof commerce.\n\n[Illustration: _The day of my departure at length arrived._]\n\nWe sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other, nor\npersuade ourselves to say the word \"Farewell!\" It was said; and we\nretired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the\nother was deceived: but when at morning's dawn I descended to the\ncarriage which was to convey me away, they were all there--my father\nagain to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to\nrenew her entreaties that I would write often, and to bestow the last\nfeminine attentions on her playmate and friend.\n\nI threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away, and indulged\nin the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by\namiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual\npleasure, I was now alone. In the university, whither I was going, I\nmust form my own friends, and be my own protector. My life had hitherto\nbeen remarkably secluded and domestic; and this had given me invincible\nrepugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and\nClerval; these were \"old familiar faces;\" but I believed myself totally\nunfitted for the company of strangers.",
    "50": " Such were my reflections as I\ncommenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I\nardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at\nhome, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place,\nand had longed to enter the world, and take my station among other\nhuman beings. Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed,\nhave been folly to repent.\n\nI had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my\njourney to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the high\nwhite steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted, and was conducted to\nmy solitary apartment, to spend the evening as I pleased.\n\nThe next morning I delivered my letters of introduction, and paid a\nvisit to some of the principal professors. Chance--or rather the evil\ninfluence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over\nme from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father's\ndoor--led me first to Mr. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He\nwas an uncouth man, but deeply embued in the secrets of his science. He\nasked me several questions concerning my progress in the different\nbranches of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied\ncarelessly; and, partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my\nalchymists as the principal authors I had studied. The professor stared:\n\"Have you,\" he said, \"really spent your time in studying such nonsense?\"\n\nI replied in the affirmative. \"Every minute,\" continued M. Krempe with\nwarmth, \"every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly\nand entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems\nand useless names.",
    "51": " Good God! in what desert land have you lived, where\nno one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies, which you have\nso greedily imbibed, are a thousand years old, and as musty as they are\nancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to\nfind a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear sir, you must\nbegin your studies entirely anew.\"\n\nSo saying, he stept aside, and wrote down a list of several books\ntreating of natural philosophy, which he desired me to procure; and\ndismissed me, after mentioning that in the beginning of the following\nweek he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural\nphilosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a\nfellow-professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that\nhe omitted.\n\nI returned home, not disappointed, for I have said that I had long\nconsidered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I\nreturned, not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any\nshape. M. Krempe was a little squat man, with a gruff voice and a\nrepulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in\nfavour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a\nstrain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come\nto concerning them in my early years. As a child, I had not been content\nwith the results promised by the modern professors of natural science.\nWith a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth,\nand my want of a guide on such matters, I",
    "52": " had retrod the steps of\nknowledge along the paths of time, and exchanged the discoveries of\nrecent enquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchymists. Besides, I had\na contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very\ndifferent, when the masters of the science sought immortality and power;\nsuch views, although futile, were grand: but now the scene was changed.\nThe ambition of the enquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation\nof those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded. I\nwas required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of\nlittle worth.\n\nSuch were my reflections during the first two or three days of my\nresidence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted\nwith the localities, and the principal residents in my new abode. But as\nthe ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information which M. Krempe\nhad given me concerning the lectures. And although I could not consent\nto go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a\npulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never\nseen, as he had hitherto been out of town.\n\nPartly from curiosity, and partly from idleness, I went into the\nlecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor\nwas very unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but\nwith an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs\ncovered his temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly\nblack.",
    "53": " His person was short, but remarkably erect; and his voice the\nsweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture by a recapitulation of\nthe history of chemistry, and the various improvements made by different\nmen of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most\ndistinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the present\nstate of the science, and explained many of its elementary terms. After\nhaving made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric\nupon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never forget:--\n\n\"The ancient teachers of this science,\" said he, \"promised\nimpossibilities, and performed nothing. The modern masters promise very\nlittle; they know that metals cannot be transmuted, and that the elixir\nof life is a chimera. But these philosophers, whose hands seem only made\nto dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or\ncrucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the\nrecesses of nature, and show how she works in her hiding places. They\nascend into the heavens: they have discovered how the blood circulates,\nand the nature of the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost\nunlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the\nearthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.\"\n\nSuch were the professor's words--rather let me say such the words of\nfate, enounced to destroy me. As he went on, I felt as if my soul were\ngrappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were\ntouched which formed the mechanism of my being: chord after chord was\nsounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,\none purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of\nFrankenstein,--more, far more, will I achieve: treading in the steps\nalready marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and\nunfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.",
    "54": "\n\nI closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of\ninsurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I\nhad no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morning's dawn, sleep\ncame. I awoke, and my yesternight's thoughts were as a dream. There\nonly remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies, and to\ndevote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a\nnatural talent. On the same day, I paid M. Waldman a visit. His manners\nin private were even more mild and attractive than in public; for there\nwas a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture, which in his own\nhouse was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I gave him\npretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to\nhis fellow-professor. He heard with attention the little narration\nconcerning my studies, and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and\nParacelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited. He\nsaid, that \"these were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern\nphilosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their\nknowledge.",
    "55": " They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names,\nand arrange in connected classifications, the facts which they in a\ngreat degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours\nof men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in\nultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.\" I listened to his\nstatement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation;\nand then added, that his lecture had removed my prejudices against\nmodern chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty\nand deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape\n(inexperience in life would have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm\nwhich stimulated my intended labours. I requested his advice concerning\nthe books I ought to procure.\n\n\"I am happy,\" said M. Waldman, \"to have gained a disciple; and if your\napplication equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success.\nChemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest\nimprovements have been and may be made: it is on that account that I\nhave made it my peculiar study; but at the same time I have not\nneglected the other branches of science.",
    "56": " A man would make but a very\nsorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge\nalone. If your wish is to become really a man of science, and not merely\na petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch\nof natural philosophy, including mathematics.\"\n\nHe then took me into his laboratory, and explained to me the uses of his\nvarious machines; instructing me as to what I ought to procure, and\npromising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough\nin the science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list\nof books which I had requested; and I took my leave.\n\nThus ended a day memorable to me: it decided my future destiny.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nFrom this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the\nmost comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.\nI read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,\nwhich modern enquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the\nlectures, and cultivated the acquaintance, of the men of science of the\nuniversity; and I found even in M.

My application was at first fluctuating and\nuncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded, and soon became so ardent\nand eager, that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning\nwhilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.\n\nAs I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress was\nrapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and my\nproficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me, with\na sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on? whilst M. Waldman expressed\nthe most heart-felt exultation in my progress. Two years passed in this\nmanner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart\nand soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries, which I hoped to make.\nNone but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements\nof science. In other studies you go as far as others have gone before\nyou, and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit\nthere is continual food for discovery and wonder. A mind of moderate\ncapacity, which closely pursues one study, must infallibly arrive at\ngreat proficiency in that study; and I, who continually sought the\nattainment of one object of pursuit, and was solely wrapt up in this,\nimproved so rapidly, that, at the end of two years, I made some\ndiscoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which\nprocured me great esteem and admiration at the university.

Darkness\nhad no effect upon my fancy; and a churchyard was to me merely the\nreceptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of\nbeauty and strength, had become food for the worm. Now I was led to\nexamine the cause and progress of this decay, and forced to spend days\nand nights in vaults and charnel-houses.

After so much time spent in painful\nlabour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires, was the most\ngratifying consummation of my toils.

Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened\nupon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a nature rather\nto direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the\nobject of my search, than to exhibit that object already accomplished.

    "63": " One secret which I alone possessed was the\nhope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight\nlabours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued\nnature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret\ntoil, as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave, or tortured\nthe living animal to animate the lifeless clay? My limbs now tremble,\nand my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless, and\nalmost frantic, impulse, urged me forward; I seemed to have lost all\nsoul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was indeed but a passing\ntrance, that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the\nunnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old habits.\nI collected bones from charnel-houses; and disturbed, with profane\nfingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame. In a solitary\nchamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all\nthe other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of\nfilthy creation: my eye-balls were starting from their sockets in\nattending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the\nslaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human\nnature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by\nan eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a\nconclusion.",
    "64": "\n\nThe summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in\none pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow\na more plentiful harvest, or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage:\nbut my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the same\nfeelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to\nforget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not\nseen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them; and I well\nremembered the words of my father: \"I know that while you are pleased\nwith yourself, you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear\nregularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any interruption in\nyour correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally\nneglected.\"\n\nI knew well therefore what would be my father's feelings; but I could\nnot tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which\nhad taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it were,\nto procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the\ngreat object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be\ncompleted.\n\nI then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect\nto vice, or faultiness on my part; ",
    "65": "but I am now convinced that he was\njustified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from\nblame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and\npeaceful mind, and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to\ndisturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge\nis an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself\nhas a tendency to weaken your affections, and to destroy your taste for\nthose simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that\nstudy is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human\nmind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit\nwhatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic\naffections, Greece had not been enslaved; C\u00e6sar would have spared his\ncountry; America would have been discovered more gradually; and the\nempires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.\n\nBut I forget that I am moralising in the most interesting part of my\ntale; and your looks remind me to proceed.\n\nMy father made no reproach in his letters, and only took notice of my\nsilence by enquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.\nWinter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not\nwatch the blossom or the expanding leaves--sights which before always\nyielded me supreme delight--so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation.",
    "66": "\nThe leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a\nclose; and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had\nsucceeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared\nrather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other\nunwholesome trade, than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.\nEvery night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a\nmost painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my\nfellow-creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew\nalarmed at the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my\npurpose alone sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed\nthat exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and\nI promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nIt was on a dreary night of November, that I beheld the accomplishment\nof my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected\nthe instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being\ninto the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the\nmorning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was\nnearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-ext",
    "67": "inguished light, I\nsaw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a\nconvulsive motion agitated its limbs.\n\n[Illustration: \"_By the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw\nthe dull, yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a\nconvulsive motion agitated its limbs, ... I rushed out of the\nroom._\"]\n\nHow can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the\nwretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form?\nHis limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as\nbeautiful. Beautiful!--Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the\nwork of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black,\nand flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only\nformed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost\nof the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his\nshrivelled complexion and straight black lips.\n\nThe different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of\nhuman nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole\npurpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived\nmyself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far\nexceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the\ndream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.",
    "68": "\nUnable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of\nthe room, and continued a long time traversing my bedchamber, unable to\ncompose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I\nhad before endured; and I threw myself on the bed in my clothes,\nendeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness. But it was in vain:\nI slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams. I thought I\nsaw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of\nIngolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her; but as I imprinted\nthe first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her\nfeatures appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my\ndead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the\ngrave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. I started from my\nsleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered,\nand every limb became convulsed: when, by the dim and yellow light of\nthe moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters, I beheld the\nwretch--the miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain\nof the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me.\nHis jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin\nwrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand\nwas stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped, and rushed\ndown stairs. I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which\nI inhabited; where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up\nand down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and\nfearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the\ndemoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life.\n\nOh! no mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy\nagain endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch.",
    "69": " I\nhad gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then; but when those\nmuscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing\nsuch as even Dante could not have conceived.\n\nI passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and\nhardly, that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly\nsank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with\nthis horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had\nbeen my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a\nhell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!\n\nMorning, dismal and wet, at length dawned, and discovered to my\nsleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple\nand clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates\nof the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the\nstreets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the\nwretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my\nview. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but felt\nimpelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured from a\nblack and comfortless sky.\n\nI continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring, by\nbodily exercise, to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed\nthe streets, without any clear conception of where I was, or what I was\ndoing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear; and I hurried on\nwith irregular steps, not daring to look about me:--\n\n    \"Like one who, on a lonely road,\n      Doth walk in fear and dread,\n    And, having once turned round, walks on,\n      And turns no more his head;\n    Because he knows a frightful fiend\n      Doth close behind him tread.",
    "70": "\"[1]\n\n[Footnote 1: Coleridge's \"Ancient Mariner.\"]\n\nContinuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the\nvarious diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew\nnot why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that\nwas coming towards me from the other end of the street. As it drew\nnearer, I observed that it was the Swiss diligence: it stopped just\nwhere I was standing; and, on the door being opened, I perceived Henry\nClerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out. \"My dear\nFrankenstein,\" exclaimed he, \"how glad I am to see you! how fortunate\nthat you should be here at the very moment of my alighting!\"\n\nNothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought\nback to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home\nso dear to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot\nmy horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during\nmany months, calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in\nthe most cordial manner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval\ncontinued talking for some time about our mutual friends, and his own\ngood fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt. \"You may easily\nbelieve,\" said he, \"how great was the difficulty to persuade my father\nthat all necessary kn",
    "71": "owledge was not comprised in the noble art of\nbook-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last,\nfor his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that\nof the Dutch schoolmaster in the Vicar of Wakefield:--'I have ten\nthousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.'\nBut his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and\nhe has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of\nknowledge.\"\n\n\"It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left\nmy father, brothers, and Elizabeth.\"\n\n\"Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you\nso seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their account\nmyself.--But, my dear Frankenstein,\" continued he, stopping short, and\ngazing full in my face, \"I did not before remark how very ill you\nappear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for\nseveral nights.\"\n\n\"You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one\noccupation, that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see:\nbut I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an\nend, and that I am at length free.",
    "72": "\"\n\nI trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to\nallude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a quick\npace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the\nthought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my\napartment might still be there, alive, and walking about. I dreaded to\nbehold this monster; but I feared still more that Henry should see him.\nEntreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the\nstairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the lock\nof the door before I recollected myself. I then paused; and a cold\nshivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as children are\naccustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them\non the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped fearfully in: the\napartment was empty; and my bed-room was also freed from its hideous\nguest. I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have\nbefallen me; but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I\nclapped my hands for joy, and ran down to Clerval.\n\nWe ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;\nbut I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed\nme; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse\nbeat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same\nplace; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.\nClerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival;\nbut when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes\nfor which he could not account; and my loud, unrestrained, heartless\nlaughter, frightened and astonished him.",
    "73": "\n\n\"My dear Victor,\" cried he, \"what, for God's sake, is the matter? Do not\nlaugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the cause of all this?\"\n\n\"Do not ask me,\" cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought\nI saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; \"_he_ can tell.--Oh, save\nme! save me!\" I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled\nfuriously, and fell down in a fit.\n\nPoor Clerval! what must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he\nanticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I was\nnot the witness of his grief; for I was lifeless, and did not recover my\nsenses for a long, long time.\n\nThis was the commencement of a nervous fever, which confined me for\nseveral months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I\nafterwards learned that, knowing my father's advanced age, and unfitness\nfor so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make\nElizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my\ndisorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive nurse\nthan himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not\ndoubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action that\nhe could towards them.\n\nBut I was in reality very ill; and surely nothing but the unbounded and\nunremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life. The\nform of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before\nmy eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my words\nsurprised Henry: he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my\ndisturbed imagination; but the pertinacity with which I continually\nrecurred to the same subject, persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed\nits origin to some uncommon and terrible event.\n\nBy very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses, that alarmed and\ngrieved my friend, I recovered.",
    "74": " I remember the first time I became\ncapable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I\nperceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared, and that the young\nbuds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was a\ndivine spring; and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence. I\nfelt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom\ndisappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was\nattacked by the fatal passion.\n\n\"Dearest Clerval,\" exclaimed I, \"how kind, how very good you are to me.\nThis whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised\nyourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever repay you?\nI feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I have been\nthe occasion; but you will forgive me.\"\n\n\"You will repay me entirely, if you do not discompose yourself, but get\nwell as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I\nmay speak to you on one subject, may I not?\"\n\nI trembled. One subject! what could it be? Could he allude to an object\non whom I dared not even think?\n\n\"Compose yourself,\" said Clerval, who observed my change of colour, \"I\nwill not mention it, if it agitates you; but your father and cousin\nwould be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own\nhandwriting.",
    "75": " They hardly know how ill you have been, and are uneasy at\nyour long silence.\"\n\n\"Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my first\nthought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love, and\nwho are so deserving of my love.\"\n\n\"If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to\nsee a letter that has been lying here some days for you: it is from your\ncousin, I believe.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nClerval then put the following letter into my hands. It was from my own\nElizabeth:--\n\n\"My dearest Cousin,\n\n\"You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind\nHenry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are\nforbidden to write--to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,\nis necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thought\nthat each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained\nmy uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have prevented his\nencountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a\njourney; yet how often have I regretted not being able to perform it\nmyself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on your sick bed\nhas devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your\nwishes, nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor\ncousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed you are getting\nbetter. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in\nyour own handwriting.\n\n\"Get well--and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home, and\nfriends who love you dearly. Your father's health is vigorous, and he\nasks but to see you,--but to be assured that you are well; and not a\ncare will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.",
    "76": " How pleased you would\nbe to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen, and full\nof activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss, and to enter\ninto foreign service; but we cannot part with him, at least until his\nelder brother return to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a\nmilitary career in a distant country; but Ernest never had your powers\nof application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter;--his time is\nspent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake. I fear\nthat he will become an idler, unless we yield the point, and permit him\nto enter on the profession which he has selected.\n\n\"Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken\nplace since you left us. The blue lake, and snow-clad mountains, they\nnever change;--and I think our placid home, and our contented hearts are\nregulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up my\ntime and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none\nbut happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one change has\ntaken place in our little household. Do you remember on what occasion\nJustine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not; I will relate\nher history, therefore, in a few words. Madame Moritz, her mother, was a\nwidow with four children, of whom Justine was the third. This girl had\nalways been the favourite of her father; but, through a strange\nperversity, her mother could not endure her, and, after the death of M.\nMoritz, treated her very ill.",
    "77": " My aunt observed this; and, when Justine\nwas twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at\nour house. The republican institutions of our country have produced\nsimpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great\nmonarchies that surround it. Hence there is less distinction between the\nseveral classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders, being neither\nso poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral. A\nservant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France\nand England. Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties of\na servant; a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include\nthe idea of ignorance, and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.\n\n\"Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I\nrecollect you once remarked, that if you were in an ill-humour, one\nglance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that\nAriosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica--she looked so\nfrank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,\nby which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which\nshe had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid; Justine was\nthe most grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she\nmade any professions; I never heard one pass her lips; but you could see\nby her eyes that she almost adored her protectress. Although her\ndisposition was gay, and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid\nthe greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt.",
    "78": " She thought her the\nmodel of all excellence, and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and\nmanners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.\n\n\"When my dearest aunt died, every one was too much occupied in their own\ngrief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness\nwith the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other\ntrials were reserved for her.\n\n\"One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the\nexception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The conscience\nof the woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her\nfavourites was a judgment from heaven to chastise her partiality. She\nwas a Roman catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea\nwhich she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months after your departure\nfor Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant mother. Poor\ngirl! she wept when she quitted our house; she was much altered since\nthe death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to\nher manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity. Nor was her\nresidence at her mother's house of a nature to restore her gaiety.",
    "79": " The\npoor woman was very vacillating in her repentance. She sometimes begged\nJustine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of\nhaving caused the deaths of her brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting\nat length threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased\nher irritability, but she is now at peace for ever. She died on the\nfirst approach of cold weather, at the beginning of this last winter.\nJustine has returned to us; and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is\nvery clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her\nmien and her expressions continually remind me of my dear aunt.\n\n\"I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling\nWilliam. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with\nsweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When he\nsmiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with\nhealth. He has already had one or two little _wives_, but Louisa Biron\nis his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.\n\n\"Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip\nconcerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield has\nalready received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage\nwith a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly sister, Manon,\nmarried M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your favourite\nschoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the\ndeparture of Clerval from Geneva. But he has already recovered his\nspirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a very lively\npretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much older\nthan Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with\neverybody.\n\n\"I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety\nreturns upon me as I conclude.",
    "80": " Write, dearest Victor,--one line--one\nword will be a blessing to us. Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his\nkindness, his affection, and his many letters: we are sincerely\ngrateful. Adieu! my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat you,\nwrite!\n\n\"ELIZABETH LAVENZA.\n\n\"Geneva, March 18th, 17--.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Dear, dear Elizabeth!\" I exclaimed, when I had read her letter, \"I will\nwrite instantly, and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel.\" I\nwrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had\ncommenced, and proceeded regularly. In another fortnight I was able to\nleave my chamber.\n\nOne of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the\nseveral professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a kind\nof rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained.\nEver since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of\nmy misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of\nnatural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the\nsight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous\nsymptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view.\nHe had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a\ndislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory. But these\ncares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors.",
    "81": " M.\nWaldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the\nastonishing progress I had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that\nI disliked the subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed\nmy feelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to\nthe science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me\nout. What could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as\nif he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments\nwhich were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel\ndeath. I writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.\nClerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the\nsensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his\ntotal ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I\nthanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly that\nhe was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and\nalthough I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew\nno bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide to him that\nevent which was so often present to my recollection, but which I feared\nthe detail to another would only impress more deeply.\n\nM. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of\nalmost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me\neven more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. \"D--n the\nfellow!\" cried he; \"why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us\nall. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A youngster\nwho, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in\nthe gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if he\nis not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.",
    "82": "--Ay, ay,\"\ncontinued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, \"M.\nFrankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man. Young men\nshould be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was myself\nwhen young; but that wears out in a very short time.\"\n\nM. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned\nthe conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.\n\nClerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his\nliterary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He\ncame to the university with the design of making himself complete master\nof the oriental languages, as thus he should open a field for the plan\nof life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no inglorious\ncareer, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording scope for his\nspirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanscrit languages\nengaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same\nstudies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I wished to\nfly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great relief in\nbeing the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction\nbut consolation in the works of the orientalists. I did not, like him,\nattempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not\ncontemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement. I\nread merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my\nlabours.",
    "83": " Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating, to a\ndegree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country.\nWhen you read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and\na garden of roses,--in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the\nfire that consumes your own heart. How different from the manly and\nheroical poetry of Greece and Rome!\n\nSummer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was\nfixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several\naccidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,\nand my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this delay\nvery bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved\nfriends. My return had only been delayed so long, from an unwillingness\nto leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become acquainted\nwith any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent cheerfully;\nand although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came its beauty\ncompensated for its dilatoriness.\n\nThe month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily\nwhich was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a\npedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a\npersonal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded with\npleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval had\nalways been my favourite companion in the rambles of this nature that I\nhad taken among the scenes of my native country.\n\nWe passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits had\nlong been restored, and they gained additional strength from the\nsalubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and\nthe conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the\nintercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but\nClerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me\nto love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.",
    "84": "\nExcellent friend! how sincerely did you love me, and endeavour to\nelevate my mind until it was on a level with your own! A selfish pursuit\nhad cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and affection warmed\nand opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few years\nago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care. When happy,\ninanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful\nsensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy. The\npresent season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the\nhedges, while those of summer were already in bud. I was undisturbed by\nthoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me,\nnotwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible\nburden.\n\nHenry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings:\nhe exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that\nfilled his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly\nastonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often,\nin imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of\nwonderful fancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite\npoems, or drew me out into arguments, which he supported with great\ningenuity.\n\nWe returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were\ndancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits\nwere high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and\nhilarity.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.",
    "85": "\n\nOn my return, I found the following letter from my father:--\n\n\"My dear Victor,\n\n\"You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of\nyour return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines,\nmerely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But that would\nbe a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be your surprise,\nmy son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the\ncontrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can I relate our\nmisfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and\ngriefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent son? I wish to\nprepare you for the woful news, but I know it is impossible; even now\nyour eye skims over the page, to seek the words which are to convey to\nyou the horrible tidings.\n\n\"William is dead!--that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed\nmy heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!\n\n\"I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the\ncircumstances of the transaction.\n\n\"Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to\nwalk in Plainpalais.",
    "86": " The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged\nour walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of\nreturning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone\non before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until\nthey should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen\nhis brother: he said, that he had been playing with him, that William\nhad run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and\nafterwards waited for him a long time, but that he did not return.\n\n\"This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him\nuntil night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned\nto the house. He was not there. We returned again, with torches; for I\ncould not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and\nwas exposed to all the damps and dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered\nextreme anguish. About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy,\nwhom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health,\nstretched on the grass livid and motionless: the print of the murderer's\nfinger was on his neck.\n\n\"He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my\ncountenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to\nsee the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her; but she persisted,\nand entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the\nvictim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, 'O God! I have murdered my\ndarling child!'\n\n\"She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again\nlived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same evening\nWilliam had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that\nshe possessed of your mother.",
    "87": " This picture is gone, and was doubtless\nthe temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We have no trace\nof him at present, although our exertions to discover him are\nunremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!\n\n\"Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps\ncontinually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her\nwords pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an\nadditional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter? Your\ndear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live to\nwitness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!\n\n\"Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,\nbut with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of\nfestering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my\nfriend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not\nwith hatred for your enemies.\n\n\"Your affectionate and afflicted father,\n\n\"ALPHONSE FRANKENSTEIN.\n\n\"Geneva, May 12th, 17--.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was\nsurprised to observe the despair that succeeded to the joy I at first\nexpressed on receiving news from my friends. I threw the letter on the\ntable, and covered my face with my hands.\n\n\"My dear Frankenstein,\" exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with\nbitterness, \"are you always to be unhappy? My dear friend, what has\nhappened?\"\n\nI motioned to him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the\nroom in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of\nClerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.\n\n\"I can offer you no consolation, my friend,\" said he; \"your disaster is\nirreparable. What do you intend to do?\"\n\n\"To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.\"\n\nDuring our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;\nhe could only express his heart-felt sympathy.",
    "88": " \"Poor William!\" said he,\n\"dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had\nseen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his\nuntimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderer's grasp! How\nmuch more a murderer, that could destroy such radiant innocence! Poor\nlittle fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep,\nbut he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for\never. A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no\nlonger be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable\nsurvivors.\"\n\nClerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words\nimpressed themselves on my mind, and I remembered them afterwards in\nsolitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a\ncabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.\n\nMy journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I\nlonged to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends;\nbut when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could\nhardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I\npassed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for\nnearly six years. How altered every thing might be during that time! One\nsudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little\ncircumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which,\nalthough they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive.\nFear overcame me; I dared not advance, dreading a thousand nameless\nevils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define them.\n\nI remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind.",
    "89": " I\ncontemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and\nthe snowy mountains, \"the palaces of nature,\" were not changed. By\ndegrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my\njourney towards Geneva.\n\nThe road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I\napproached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black sides\nof Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a child.\n\"Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your\nwanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid.\nIs this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?\"\n\nI fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on\nthese preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative\nhappiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved\ncountry! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding\nthy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake!\n\nYet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also\nclosed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt\nstill more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil,\nand I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched\nof human beings.",
    "90": " Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single\ncircumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not\nconceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.\n\nIt was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the\ngates of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night\nat Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city.\nThe sky was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit\nthe spot where my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass\nthrough the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at\nPlainpalais. During this short voyage I saw the lightnings playing on\nthe summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm\nappeared to approach rapidly; and, on landing, I ascended a low hill,\nthat I might observe its progress. It advanced; the heavens were\nclouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its\nviolence quickly increased.\n\nI quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm\nincreased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over\nmy head. It was echoed from Sal\u00eave, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy;\nvivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake,\nmaking it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every\nthing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself from\nthe preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in Switzerland,\nappeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The most violent storm\nhung exactly north of the town, over that part of the lake which lies\nbetween the promontory of Belrive and the village of Cop\u00eat.",
    "91": " Another\nstorm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another darkened and\nsometimes disclosed the M\u00f4le, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake.\n\nWhile I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on\nwith a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I\nclasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud, \"William, dear angel! this is thy\nfuneral, this thy dirge!\" As I said these words, I perceived in the\ngloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood\nfixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning\nilluminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its\ngigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect, more hideous than\nbelongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the\nfilthy d\u00e6mon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be\n(I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner\ndid that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its\ntruth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for\nsupport. The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom.\nNothing in human shape could have destroyed that fair child. _He_ was\nthe murderer! I could not doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an\nirresistible proof of the fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it\nwould have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging\namong the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Sal\u00eave, a\nhill that bounds Plainpalais on the south. He soon reached the summit,\nand disappeared.\n\nI remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued,\nand the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I revolved in\nmy mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole\ntrain of my progress towards the creation; the appearance of the work of\nmy own hands alive at my bedside; its departure.",
    "92": " Two years had now\nnearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was\nthis his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a depraved\nwretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my\nbrother?\n\nNo one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the\nnight, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel\nthe inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of\nevil and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind,\nand endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such\nas the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own\nvampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy\nall that was dear to me.\n\nDay dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were\nopen, and I hastened to my father's house. My first thought was to\ndiscover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be\nmade. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A\nbeing whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at\nmidnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain.",
    "93": " I remembered\nalso the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time\nthat I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a\ntale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that if any other had\ncommunicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the\nravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature of the animal would\nelude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my\nrelatives to commence it. And then of what use would be pursuit? Who\ncould arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont\nSal\u00eave? These reflections determined me, and I resolved to remain\nsilent.\n\nIt was about five in the morning when I entered my father's house. I\ntold the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library\nto attend their usual hour of rising.\n\nSix years had elapsed, passed as a dream but for one indelible trace,\nand I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before\nmy departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still\nremained to me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over\nthe mantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father's\ndesire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair,\nkneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her\ncheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly\npermitted the sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of\nWilliam; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus\nengaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome\nme.",
    "94": " He expressed a sorrowful delight to see me: \"Welcome, my dearest\nVictor,\" said he. \"Ah! I wish you had come three months ago, and then\nyou would have found us all joyous and delighted. You come to us now to\nshare a misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I\nhope, revive our father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; and\nyour persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and\ntormenting self-accusations.--Poor William! he was our darling and our\npride!\"\n\nTears, unrestrained, fell from my brother's eyes; a sense of mortal\nagony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the wretchedness\nof my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and a not less\nterrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more minutely\nconcerning my father, and her I named my cousin.\n\n\"She most of all,\" said Ernest, \"requires consolation; she accused\nherself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her very\nwretched. But since the murderer has been discovered--\"\n\n\"The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt\nto pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the\nwinds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he was\nfree last night!\"\n\n\"I do not know what you mean,\" replied my brother, in accents of wonder,\n\"but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery.",
    "95": " No one would\nbelieve it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced,\nnotwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit that Justine\nMoritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family, could suddenly\nbecome capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?\"\n\n\"Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is\nwrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?\"\n\n\"No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have\nalmost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so\nconfused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,\nleaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried to-day, and you will\nthen hear all.\"\n\nHe related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had\nbeen discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her bed for\nseveral days. During this interval, one of the servants, happening to\nexamine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had\ndiscovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which had been judged\nto be the temptation of the murderer.",
    "96": " The servant instantly showed it to\none of the others, who, without saying a word to any of the family, went\nto a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended. On\nbeing charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a\ngreat measure by her extreme confusion of manner.\n\nThis was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied\nearnestly, \"You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor,\ngood Justine, is innocent.\"\n\nAt that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on\nhis countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after\nwe had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other\ntopic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, \"Good God,\npapa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William.\"\n\n\"We do also, unfortunately,\" replied my father; \"for indeed I had rather\nhave been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and\ningratitude in one I valued so highly.\"\n\n\"My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.\"\n\n\"If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be\ntried to-day, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.",
    "97": "\"\n\nThis speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that\nJustine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I\nhad no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be\nbrought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to\nannounce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness\nby the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, the creator, who\nwould believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the existence of the\nliving monument of presumption and rash ignorance which I had let loose\nupon the world?\n\nWe were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last\nbeheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of\nher childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but\nit was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.\nShe welcomed me with the greatest affection. \"Your arrival, my dear\ncousin,\" said she, \"fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some means\nto justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she be\nconvicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my\nown. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that\nlovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be\ntorn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I never shall know\njoy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not; and then I shall be\nhappy again, even after the sad death of my little William.\"\n\n\"She is innocent, my Elizabeth,\" said I, \"and that shall be proved; fear\nnothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her\nacquittal.",
    "98": "\"\n\n\"How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt,\nand that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to see\nevery one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and\ndespairing.\" She wept.\n\n\"Dearest niece,\" said my father, \"dry your tears. If she is, as you\nbelieve, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the activity\nwith which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nWe passed a few sad hours, until eleven o'clock, when the trial was to\ncommence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend\nas witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this\nwretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to be\ndecided, whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would\ncause the death of two of my fellow-beings: one a smiling babe, full of\ninnocence and joy; the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every\naggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.\nJustine also was a girl of merit, and possessed qualities which promised\nto render her life happy: now all was to be obliterated in an\nignominious grave; and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I have\nconfessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine; but I was\nabsent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have been\nconsidered as the ravings of a madman, and would not have exculpated her\nwho suffered through me.",
    "99": "\n\nThe appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning; and her\ncountenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her\nfeelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in\ninnocence, and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by\nthousands; for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have\nexcited, was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the\nimagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She was\ntranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her\nconfusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up\nher mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the court, she\nthrew her eyes round it, and quickly discovered where we were seated. A\ntear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us; but she quickly recovered\nherself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter\nguiltlessness.\n\nThe trial began; and, after the advocate against her had stated the\ncharge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined\nagainst her, which might have staggered any one who had not such proof\nof her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on\nwhich the murder had been committed, and towards morning had been\nperceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the\nmurdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she\ndid there; but she looked very strangely, and only returned a confused\nand unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight\no'clock; and, when one enquired where she had passed the night, she\nreplied that she had been looking for the child, and demanded earnestly\nif any thing had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she\nfell into violent hysterics, and kept her bed for several days.",
    "100": " The\npicture was then produced, which the servant had found in her pocket;\nand when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same\nwhich, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round\nhis neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.\n\nJustine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her\ncountenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly\nexpressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears; but, when she was\ndesired to plead, she collected her powers, and spoke, in an audible,\nalthough variable voice.\n\n\"God knows,\" she said, \"how entirely I am innocent. But I do not pretend\nthat my protestations should acquit me: I rest my innocence on a plain\nand simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me;\nand I hope the character I have always borne will incline my judges to a\nfavourable interpretation, where any circumstance appears doubtful or\nsuspicious.\"\n\nShe then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed\nthe evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the\nhouse of an aunt at Ch\u00eane, a village situated at about a league from\nGeneva. On her return, at about nine o'clock, she met a man, who asked\nher if she had seen any thing of the child who was lost. She was alarmed\nby this account, and passed several hours in looking for him, when the\ngates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of\nthe night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up\nthe inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most of the night she spent\nhere watching; towards morning she believed that she slept for a few\nminutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke. It was dawn, and she\nquitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour to find my brother.\nIf she had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was without her\nknowledge.",
    "101": " That she had been bewildered when questioned by the\nmarket-woman was not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless night,\nand the fate of poor William was yet uncertain. Concerning the picture\nshe could give no account.\n\n\"I know,\" continued the unhappy victim, \"how heavily and fatally this\none circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining\nit; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to\nconjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been\nplaced in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have\nno enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to\ndestroy me wantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no\nopportunity afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have\nstolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon?\n\n\"I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for\nhope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my\ncharacter; and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt,\nI must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my\ninnocence.",
    "102": "\"\n\nSeveral witnesses were called, who had known her for many years, and\nthey spoke well of her; but fear, and hatred of the crime of which they\nsupposed her guilty, rendered them timorous, and unwilling to come\nforward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent\ndispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,\nwhen, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address the\ncourt.\n\n\"I am,\" said she, \"the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or\nrather his sister, for I was educated by, and have lived with his\nparents ever since and even long before, his birth. It may therefore be\njudged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion; but when I see a\nfellow-creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended\nfriends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of\nher character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived in\nthe same house with her, at one time for five, and at another for nearly\ntwo years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable\nand benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my\naunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection and care; and\nafterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner\nthat excited the admiration of all who knew her; after which she again\nlived in my uncle's house, where she was beloved by all the family. She\nwas warmly attached to the child who is now dead, and acted towards him\nlike a most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to\nsay, that, notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I\nbelieve and rely on her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for\nsuch an action: as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she\nhad earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to her; so\nmuch do I esteem and value her.",
    "103": "\"\n\nA murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth's simple and powerful appeal;\nbut it was excited by her generous interference, and not in favour of\npoor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed\nviolence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She herself wept\nas Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own agitation and anguish\nwas extreme during the whole trial. I believed in her innocence; I knew\nit. Could the d\u00e6mon, who had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my\nbrother, also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death\nand ignominy? I could not sustain the horror of my situation; and when I\nperceived that the popular voice, and the countenances of the judges,\nhad already condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in\nagony. The tortures of the accused did not equal mine; she was sustained\nby innocence, but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom, and would not\nforego their hold.\n\nI passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to the\ncourt; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal\nquestion; but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my\nvisit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was\ncondemned.\n\nI cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before experienced\nsensations of horror; and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them\nadequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the\nheart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to whom I\naddressed myself added, that Justine had already confessed her guilt.\n\"That evidence,\" he observed, \"was hardly required in so glaring a case,\nbut I am glad of it; and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a\ncriminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive.\"\n\nThis was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had my\neyes deceived me? and was I ",
    "104": "really as mad as the whole world would\nbelieve me to be, if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I hastened\nto return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.\n\n\"My cousin,\" replied I, \"it is decided as you may have expected; all\njudges had rather that ten innocent should suffer, than that one guilty\nshould escape. But she has confessed.\"\n\nThis was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness\nupon Justine's innocence. \"Alas!\" said she, \"how shall I ever again\nbelieve in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my\nsister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?\nher mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has\ncommitted a murder.\"\n\nSoon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see\nmy cousin. My father wished her not to go; but said, that he left it to\nher own judgment and feelings to decide. \"Yes,\" said Elizabeth, \"I will\ngo, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me: I\ncannot go alone.\" The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could\nnot refuse.",
    "105": "\n\nWe entered the gloomy prison-chamber, and beheld Justine sitting on some\nstraw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested\non her knees. She rose on seeing us enter; and when we were left alone\nwith her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly.\nMy cousin wept also.\n\n\"Oh, Justine!\" said she, \"why did you rob me of my last consolation? I\nrelied on your innocence; and although I was then very wretched, I was\nnot so miserable as I am now.\"\n\n\"And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also\njoin with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?\" Her\nvoice was suffocated with sobs.\n\n\"Rise, my poor girl,\" said Elizabeth, \"why do you kneel, if you are\ninnocent? I am not one of your enemies; I believed you guiltless,\nnotwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had yourself\ndeclared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be assured,\ndear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment,\nbut your own confession.",
    "106": "\"\n\n\"I did confess; but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might obtain\nabsolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my\nother sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was condemned, my\nconfessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I almost\nbegan to think that I was the monster that he said I was. He threatened\nexcommunication and hell fire in my last moments, if I continued\nobdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked on me as a\nwretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do? In an evil\nhour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly miserable.\"\n\nShe paused, weeping, and then continued--\"I thought with horror, my\nsweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt\nhad so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable of a\ncrime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated. Dear\nWilliam! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in heaven,\nwhere we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to\nsuffer ignominy and death.\"\n\n\"Oh, Justine! forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you. Why\ndid you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I will\nproclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony hearts of\nyour enemies by my tears and prayers.",
    "107": " You shall not die!--You, my\nplay-fellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold! No! no! I\nnever could survive so horrible a misfortune.\"\n\nJustine shook her head mournfully. \"I do now not fear to die,\" she said;\n\"that pang is past. God raises my weakness, and gives me courage to\nendure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember\nme, and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the\nfate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to the\nwill of Heaven!\"\n\nDuring this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison-room,\nwhere I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair! Who\ndared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the\nawful boundary between life and death, felt not as I did, such deep and\nbitter agony. I gnashed my teeth, and ground them together, uttering a\ngroan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When she saw who\nit was, she approached me, and said, \"Dear sir, you are very kind to\nvisit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?\"\n\nI could not answer. \"No, Justine,\" said Elizabeth; \"he is more convinced\nof your innocence than I was; for even when he heard that you had\nconfessed, he did not credit it.\"\n\n\"I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude\ntowards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is the affection\nof others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than half my\nmisfortune; and I feel as if I could die in peace, now that my innocence\nis acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.\"\n\nThus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself.",
    "108": " She indeed\ngained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the\nnever-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or\nconsolation. Elizabeth also wept, and was unhappy; but her's also was\nthe misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair\nmoon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and\ndespair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within\nme, which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with\nJustine; and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear\nherself away. \"I wish,\" cried she, \"that I were to die with you; I\ncannot live in this world of misery.\"\n\nJustine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty\nrepressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth, and said, in a voice\nof half-suppressed emotion, \"Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my\nbeloved and only friend; may Heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve\nyou; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer! Live,\nand be happy, and make others so.\"\n\nAnd on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth's heart-rending eloquence\nfailed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the\ncriminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant appeals\nwere lost upon them. And when I received their cold answers, and heard\nthe harsh unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed avowal died away\non my lips.",
    "109": " Thus I might proclaim myself a madman, but not revoke the\nsentence passed upon my wretched victim. She perished on the scaffold as\na murderess!\n\nFrom the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and\nvoiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my father's\nwoe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home--all was the work\nof my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones; but these are not\nyour last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and the sound\nof your lamentations shall again and again be heard! Frankenstein, your\nson, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would spend\neach vital drop of blood for your sakes--who has no thought nor sense of\njoy, except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances--who would\nfill the air with blessings, and spend his life in serving you--he bids\nyou weep--to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus\ninexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the\npeace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!\n\nThus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,\nI beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and\nJustine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nNothing is more painful to the human mind, than, after the feelings have\nbeen worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of\ninaction and certainty which follows, and deprives the soul both of hope\nand fear. Justine died; she rested; and I was alive.",
    "110": " The blood flowed\nfreely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my\nheart, which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered\nlike an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond\ndescription horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself), was yet\nbehind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness, and the love of virtue. I\nhad begun life with benevolent intentions, and thirsted for the moment\nwhen I should put them in practice, and make myself useful to my\nfellow-beings. Now all was blasted: instead of that serenity of\nconscience, which allowed me to look back upon the past with\nself-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was\nseized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a\nhell of intense tortures, such as no language can describe.\n\nThis state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never\nentirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned the\nface of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude\nwas my only consolation--deep, dark, deathlike solitude.",
    "111": "\n\nMy father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my\ndisposition and habits, and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the\nfeelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life, to inspire me with\nfortitude, and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which\nbrooded over me. \"Do you think, Victor,\" said he, \"that I do not suffer\nalso? No one could love a child more than I loved your brother;\" (tears\ncame into his eyes as he spoke;) \"but is it not a duty to the survivors,\nthat we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an\nappearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty owed to yourself; for\nexcessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the\ndischarge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society.\"\n\nThis advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I\nshould have been the first to hide my grief, and console my friends, if\nremorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm with my\nother sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look of\ndespair, and endeavour to hide myself from his view.\n\nAbout this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was\nparticularly agreeable to me.",
    "112": " The shutting of the gates regularly at ten\no'clock, and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour,\nhad rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome to\nme. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had retired for\nthe night, I took the boat, and passed many hours upon the water.\nSometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and sometimes,\nafter rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to pursue its\nown course, and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I was often\ntempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet thing\nthat wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly--if I except\nsome bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard\nonly when I approached the shore--often, I say, I was tempted to plunge\ninto the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my\ncalamities for ever. But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic\nand suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence was\nbound up in mine.",
    "113": " I thought also of my father, and surviving brother:\nshould I by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the\nmalice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them?\n\nAt these moments I wept bitterly, and wished that peace would revisit my\nmind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that\ncould not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of\nunalterable evils; and I lived in daily fear, lest the monster whom I\nhad created should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure\nfeeling that all was not over, and that he would still commit some\nsignal crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the\nrecollection of the past. There was always scope for fear, so long as\nany thing I loved remained behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be\nconceived. When I thought of him, I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became\ninflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so\nthoughtlessly bestowed. When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my\nhatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation. I would have made a\npilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes, could I, when there, have\nprecipitated him to their base. I wished to see him again, that I might\nwreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head, and avenge the deaths\nof William and Justine.\n\nOur house was the house of mourning. My father's health was deeply\nshaken by the horror of the recent events.",
    "114": " Elizabeth was sad and\ndesponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all\npleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears\nshe then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so\nblasted and destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature, who in\nearlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake, and talked with\necstasy of our future prospects. The first of those sorrows which are\nsent to wean us from the earth, had visited her, and its dimming\ninfluence quenched her dearest smiles.\n\n\"When I reflect, my dear cousin,\" said she, \"on the miserable death of\nJustine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before\nappeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and\ninjustice, that I read in books or heard from others, as tales of\nancient days, or imaginary evils; at least they were remote, and more\nfamiliar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come\nhome, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other's blood.\nYet I am certainly unjust. Every body believed that poor girl to be\nguilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she\nsuffered, assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human\ncreatures. For the sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her\nbenefactor and friend, a child whom she had nur",
    "115": "sed from its birth, and\nappeared to love as if it had been her own! I could not consent to the\ndeath of any human being; but certainly I should have thought such a\ncreature unfit to remain in the society of men. But she was innocent. I\nknow, I feel she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that\nconfirms me. Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth,\nwho can assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were\nwalking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are\ncrowding, and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and\nJustine were assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the\nworld free, and perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to\nsuffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places\nwith such a wretch.\"\n\nI listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed,\nbut in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my\ncountenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, \"My dearest friend, you\nmust calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how deeply;\nbut I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of despair,\nand sometimes of revenge, in your countenance, that makes me tremble.\nDear Victor, banish these dark passions. Remember the friends around\nyou, who centre all their hopes in you.",
    "116": " Have we lost the power of\nrendering you happy? Ah! while we love--while we are true to each other,\nhere in this land of peace and beauty, your native country, we may reap\nevery tranquil blessing,--what can disturb our peace?\"\n\nAnd could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every\nother gift of fortune, suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my\nheart? Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror; lest at\nthat very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.\n\nThus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of\nheaven, could redeem my soul from woe: the very accents of love were\nineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence\ncould penetrate. The wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some\nuntrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it, and\nto die--was but a type of me.\n\nSometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me: but\nsometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily\nexercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable\nsensations. It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my\nhome, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought in\nthe magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and my\nephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed towards\nthe valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during my boyhood.\nSix years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck--but nought had changed\nin those savage and enduring scenes.\n\nI performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards\nhired a mule, as the more sure-footed, and least liable to receive\ninjury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine: it was about the\nmiddle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of\nJustine; that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe.",
    "117": " The weight\nupon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the\nravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on\nevery side--the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and the\ndashing of the waterfalls around, spoke of a power mighty as\nOmnipotence--and I ceased to fear, or to bend before any being less\nalmighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here\ndisplayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher, the\nvalley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character. Ruined\ncastles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains; the impetuous\nArve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the\ntrees, formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was augmented and\nrendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining pyramids\nand domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the\nhabitations of another race of beings.\n\nI passed the bridge of P\u00e9lissier, where the ravine, which the river\nforms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that\noverhangs it. Soon after I entered the valley of Chamounix. This valley\nis more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and picturesque, as\nthat of Servox, through which I had just passed. The high and snowy\nmountains were its immediate boundaries; but I saw no more ruined\ncastles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached the road; I\nheard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche, and marked the\nsmoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont\nBlanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_, and its\ntremendous _d\u00f4me_ overlooked the valley.\n\nA tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this\njourney. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and\nrecognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing\naccents, and maternal nature bade me weep no more.",
    "118": " Then again the kindly\ninfluence ceased to act--I found myself fettered again to grief, and\nindulging in all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my animal,\nstriving so to forget the world, my fears, and, more than all,\nmyself--or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted, and threw myself on\nthe grass, weighed down by horror and despair.\n\nAt length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded to\nthe extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured. For a\nshort space of time I remained at the window, watching the pallid\nlightnings that played above Mont Blanc, and listening to the rushing of\nthe Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds\nacted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations: when I placed my head upon\nmy pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came, and blest the\ngiver of oblivion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nI spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside the\nsources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that with\nslow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills, to barricade\nthe valley. The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy\nwall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were scattered\naround; and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of\nimperial Nature was broken only by the brawling waves, or the fall of\nsome",
    "119": " vast fragment, the thunder sound of the avalanche, or the cracking,\nreverberated along the mountains of the accumulated ice, which, through\nthe silent working of immutable laws, was ever and anon rent and torn,\nas if it had been but a plaything in their hands. These sublime and\nmagnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was\ncapable of receiving. They elevated me from all littleness of feeling;\nand although they did not remove my grief, they subdued and\ntranquillised it. In some degree, also, they diverted my mind from the\nthoughts over which it had brooded for the last month. I retired to rest\nat night; my slumbers, as it were, waited on and ministered to by the\nassemblance of grand shapes which I had contemplated during the day.\nThey congregated round me; the unstained snowy mountain-top, the\nglittering pinnacle, the pine woods, and ragged bare ravine; the eagle,\nsoaring amidst the clouds--they all gathered round me, and bade me be at\npeace.\n\nWhere had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of\nsoul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every\nthought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the\nsummits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those\nmighty friends.",
    "120": " Still I would penetrate their misty veil, and seek them\nin their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was\nbrought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of\nMontanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and\never-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it. It\nhad then filled me with a sublime ecstasy, that gave wings to the soul,\nand allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy. The\nsight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect\nof solemnising my mind, and causing me to forget the passing cares of\nlife. I determined to go without a guide, for I was well acquainted with\nthe path, and the presence of another would destroy the solitary\ngrandeur of the scene.\n\nThe ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short\nwindings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the\nmountain. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots the\ntraces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken\nand strewed on the ground; some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning\nupon the jutting rocks of the mountain, or transversely upon other\ntrees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines of\nsnow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is\nparticularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in\na loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw\ndestruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or\nluxuriant, but they are sombre, and add an air of severity to the scene.\nI looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers\nwhich ran through it, and curling in thick wreaths",
    "121": " around the opposite\nmountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain\npoured from the dark sky, and added to the melancholy impression I\nreceived from the objects around me. Alas! why does man boast of\nsensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders\nthem more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger,\nthirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by\nevery wind that blows, and a chance word or scene that that word may\nconvey to us.\n\n    We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.\n      We rise; one wand'ring thought pollutes the day.\n    We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,\n      Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;\n    It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,\n      The path of its departure still is free.\n    Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;\n      Nought may endure but mutability!\n\nIt was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some\ntime I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered\nboth that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated\nthe cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is very uneven,\nrising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and\ninterspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a\nleague in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The\nopposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I\nnow stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;\nand above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess\nof the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea, or\nrather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains, whose\naerial summits hung over its recesses.",
    "122": " Their icy and glittering peaks\nshone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was before\nsorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed--\"Wandering\nspirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow\nme this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the\njoys of life.\"\n\nAs I said this, I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,\nadvancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices\nin the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature, also, as\nhe approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was troubled: a mist came\nover my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me; but I was quickly\nrestored by the cold gale of the mountains. I perceived, as the shape\ncame nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!) that it was the wretch\nwhom I had created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait\nhis approach, and then close with him in mortal combat. He approached;\nhis countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and\nmalignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible\nfor human eyes. But I scarcely observed this; rage and hatred had at\nfirst deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm him\nwith words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.",
    "123": "\n\n\"Devil,\" I exclaimed, \"do you dare approach me? and do not you fear the\nfierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head? Begone, vile\ninsect! or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! and, oh! that I\ncould, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore those\nvictims whom you have so diabolically murdered!\"\n\n\"I expected this reception,\" said the d\u00e6mon. \"All men hate the wretched;\nhow, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things!\nYet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art\nbound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us. You\npurpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life? Do your duty\ntowards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind.

    "124": "\n\nHe easily eluded me, and said--\n\n\"Be calm! I entreat you to hear me, before you give vent to your hatred\non my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to\nincrease my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of\nanguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made\nme more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine; my joints\nmore supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to\nthee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my\nnatural lord and king, if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which\nthou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other, and\ntrample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and\naffection, is most due. Remember, that I am thy creature; I ought to be\nthy Adam; but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy\nfor no misdeed.

Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable\neye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and compassion?

You, my creator, abhor\nme; what hope can I gather from your fellow-creatures, who owe me\nnothing? They spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and dreary\nglaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the caves of\nice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one\nwhich man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder\nto me than your fellow-beings. If the multitude of mankind knew of my\nexistence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for my\ndestruction.",

My heart was\nfull, and I did not answer him; but, as I proceeded, I weighed the\nvarious arguments that he had used, and determined at least to listen to\nhis tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my\nresolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my\nbrother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.\nFor the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards\nhis creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I\ncomplained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with his\ndemand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock.\nThe air was cold, and the rain again began to descend: we entered the\nhut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy heart, and\ndepressed spirits.

    "127": "\nA strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,\nand smelt, at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I\nlearned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By\ndegrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I\nwas obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me, and troubled\nme; but hardly had I felt this, when, by opening my eyes, as I now\nsuppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked, and, I believe,\ndescended; but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.\nBefore, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch\nor sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with no\nobstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light became\nmore and more oppressive to me; and, the heat wearying me as I walked, I\nsought a place where I could receive shade. This was the forest near\nIngolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my\nfatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This roused me\nfrom my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I found\nhanging on the trees, or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst at the\nbrook; and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.",
    "128": "\n\n\"It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half-frightened, as it\nwere instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted\nyour apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some\nclothes; but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of\nnight. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could\ndistinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat\ndown and wept.\n\n\"Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens, and gave me a sensation of\npleasure. I started up, and beheld a radiant form rise from among the\ntrees.[2] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly, but it\nenlightened my path; and I again went out in search of berries. I was\nstill cold, when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with which\nI covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinct ideas\noccupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger, and\nthirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rung in my ears, and on all\nsides various scents saluted me: the only object that I could\ndistinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with\npleasure.\n\n[Footnote 2: The moon.]\n\n\"Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had\ngreatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each\nother. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with\ndrink, and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted\nwhen I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my\nears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had\noften intercepted the light from my eyes.",
    "129": " I began also to observe, with\ngreater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me, and to perceive the\nboundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I\ntried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds, but was unable.\nSometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the\nuncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into\nsilence again.\n\n\"The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened\nform, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My sensations\nhad, by this time, become distinct, and my mind received every day\nadditional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light, and to\nperceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from\nthe herb, and, by degrees, one herb from another. I found that the\nsparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and\nthrush were sweet and enticing.\n\n\"One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been\nleft by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the\nwarmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live\nembers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange, I\nthought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! I\nexamined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be\ncomposed of wood. I quickly collected some branches; but they were wet,\nand would not burn. I was pained at this, and sat still watching the\noperation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed near the heat\ndried, and itself became inflamed.",
    "130": " I reflected on this; and, by touching\nthe various branches, I discovered the cause, and busied myself in\ncollecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it, and have a\nplentiful supply of fire. When night came on, and brought sleep with it,\nI was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I\ncovered it carefully with dry wood and leaves, and placed wet branches\nupon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground, and sunk\ninto sleep.\n\n\"It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire. I\nuncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I\nobserved this also, and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the\nembers when they were nearly extinguished. When night came again, I\nfound, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat; and that\nthe discovery of this element was useful to me in my food; for I found\nsome of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and\ntasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. I\ntried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on the\nlive embers.",
    "131": " I found that the berries were spoiled by this operation,\nand the nuts and roots much improved.\n\n\"Food, however, became scarce; and I often spent the whole day searching\nin vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When I found\nthis, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to\nseek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily\nsatisfied. In this emigration, I exceedingly lamented the loss of the\nfire which I had obtained through accident, and knew not how to\nreproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration of this\ndifficulty; but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it;\nand, wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood towards\nthe setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles, and at length\ndiscovered the open country. A great fall of snow had taken place the\nnight before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the appearance\nwas disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance\nthat covered the ground.\n\n\"It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and\nshelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which\nhad doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This was\na new sight to me; and I examined the structure with great curiosity.\nFinding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it, near a fire,\nover which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on hearing a noise;\nand, perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and, quitting the hut, ran across\nthe fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared\ncapable. His appearance, different from any I had ever before seen, and\nhis flight, somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted by the appearance\nof the hut: here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was\n",
    "132": "dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as\nPand\u00e6monium appeared to the d\u00e6mons of hell after their sufferings in the\nlake of fire. I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd's\nbreakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter,\nhowever, I did not like. Then, overcome by fatigue, I lay down among\nsome straw, and fell asleep.\n\n\"It was noon when I awoke; and, allured by the warmth of the sun, which\nshone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my\ntravels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant's breakfast in a\nwallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until\nat sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! the\nhuts, the neater cottages, and stately houses, engaged my admiration by\nturns. The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw\nplaced at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One\nof the best of these I entered; but I had hardly placed my foot within\nthe door, before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.\nThe whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,\ngrievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I\nescaped to the open country, and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,\nquite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had\nbeheld in the village. This hovel, however, joined a cottage of a neat\nand pleasant appearance; but, after my late dearly bought experience, I\ndared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so\nlow, that I could with difficulty sit upright in it.",
    "133": " No wood, however,\nwas placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and\nalthough the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an\nagreeable asylum from the snow and rain.\n\n\"Here then I retreated, and lay down happy to have found a shelter,\nhowever miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more\nfrom the barbarity of man.\n\n\"As soon as morning dawned, I crept from my kennel, that I might view\nthe adjacent cottage, and discover if I could remain in the habitation I\nhad found. It was situated against the back of the cottage, and\nsurrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig-sty and a clear pool\nof water. One part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I\ncovered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and\nwood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass\nout: all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and that was\nsufficient for me.\n\n\"Having thus arranged my dwelling, and carpeted it with clean straw, I\nretired; for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered\ntoo well my treatment the night before, to trust myself in his power. I\nhad first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day, by a loaf\nof coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink,\nmore conveniently than from my hand, of the pure water which flowed by\nmy retreat.",
    "134": " The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly\ndry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably\nwarm.\n\n\"Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel, until\nsomething should occur which might alter my determination. It was indeed\na paradise, compared to the bleak forest, my former residence, the\nrain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with\npleasure, and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little\nwater, when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld\na young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The\ngirl was young, and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found\ncottagers and farm-house servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a\ncoarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair\nhair was plaited, but not adorned: she looked patient, yet sad. I lost\nsight of her; and in about a quarter of an hour she returned, bearing\nthe pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along,\nseemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose\ncountenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with\nan air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head, and bore it to the\ncottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw the\nyoung man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the\ncottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house, and\nsometimes in the yard.\n\n\"On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the\ncottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been\nfilled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost\nimperceptible chink, through which the eye could just penetrate. Through\nthis crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean, but very\nbare of furniture.",
    "135": " In one corner, near a small fire, sat an old man,\nleaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The young\ngirl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took\nsomething out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat down\nbeside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play, and to\nproduce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale.\nIt was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch! who had never beheld\naught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent countenance of\nthe aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle manners of the girl\nenticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air, which I perceived drew\ntears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took\nno notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds,\nand the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet. He raised\nher, and smiled with such kindness and affection, that I felt sensations\nof a peculiar and overpowering nature: they were a mixture of pain and\npleasure, such as I had never before experienced, either from hunger or\ncold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the window, unable to bear\nthese emotions.\n\n\"Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load\nof wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his\nburden, and, taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the\nfire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and\nhe showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed pleased,\nand went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in\nwater, and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her work, whilst\nthe young man went into the garden, and appeared busily employed in\ndigging and pulling up roots.",
    "136": " After he had been employed thus about an\nhour, the young woman joined him, and they entered the cottage together.\n\n\"The old man had, in the mean time, been pensive; but, on the appearance\nof his companions, he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to\neat. The meal was quickly despatched. The young woman was again occupied\nin arranging the cottage; the old man walked before the cottage in the\nsun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth. Nothing could\nexceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures.\nOne was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with\nbenevolence and love: the younger was slight and graceful in his figure,\nand his features were moulded with the finest symmetry; yet his eyes and\nattitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The old man\nreturned to the cottage; and the youth, with tools different from those\nhe had used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields.\n\n\"Night quickly shut in; but, to my extreme wonder, I found that the\ncottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was\ndelighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the\npleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening,\nthe young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations\nwhich I did not understand; and the old man again took up the instrument\nwhich produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning.\nSo soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter\nsounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony of the\nold man's instrument nor the songs of the birds: I since found that he\nread aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or\nletters.\n\n\"The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time,\nextinguished their lights, and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.",
    "137": "\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\n\"I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the occurrences\nof the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these\npeople; and I longed to join them, but dared not. I remembered too well\nthe treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous\nvillagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter\nthink it right to pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in\nmy hovel, watching, and endeavouring to discover the motives which\ninfluenced their actions.\n\n\"The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman\narranged the cottage, and prepared the food; and the youth departed\nafter the first meal.\n\n\"This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it. The\nyoung man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various\nlaborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon perceived to be\nblind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation.\nNothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers\nexhibited towards their venerable companion. They performed towards him\nevery little office of affection and duty with gentleness; and he\nrewarded them by his benevolent smiles.\n\n\"They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often\nwent apart, and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness;\nbut I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were\nmiserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,\nshould be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They\npossessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every\nluxury; they had a fire to warm the",
    "138": "m when chill, and delicious viands\nwhen hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,\nthey enjoyed one another's company and speech, interchanging each day\nlooks of affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they\nreally express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions; but\nperpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were\nat first enigmatic.\n\n\"A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of\nthe uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty; and they suffered\nthat evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment consisted\nentirely of the vegetables of their garden, and the milk of one cow,\nwhich gave very little during the winter, when its masters could\nscarcely procure food to support it. They often, I believe, suffered the\npangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers;\nfor several times they placed food before the old man, when they\nreserved none for themselves.\n\n\"This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed, during\nthe night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption; but\nwhen I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I\nabstained, and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots, which I\ngathered from a neighbouring wood.\n\n\"I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist\ntheir labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in\ncollecting wood for the family fire; and, during the night, I often took\nhis tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home\nfiring sufficient for the consumption of several days.",
    "139": "\n\n\"I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she\nopened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a\ngreat pile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud\nvoice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I\nobserved, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but\nspent it in repairing the cottage, and cultivating the garden.\n\n\"By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that\nthese people possessed a method of communicating their experience and\nfeelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words\nthey spoke sometimes, produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in\nthe minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike\nscience, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was\nbaffled in every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation\nwas quick; and the words they uttered, not having any apparent\nconnection with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue by\nwhich I could unravel the mystery of their reference. By great\napplication, however, and after having remained during the space of\nseveral revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered the names that\nwere given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned\nand applied the words, _fire_, _milk_, _bread_, and _wood_.",
    "140": " I learned\nalso the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth and his companion\nhad each of them several names, but the old man had only one, which was\n_father_. The girl was called _sister_, or _Agatha_; and the youth\n_Felix_, _brother_, or _son_. I cannot describe the delight I felt when\nI learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds, and was able\nto pronounce them. I distinguished several other words, without being\nable as yet to understand or apply them; such as _good_, _dearest_,\n_unhappy_.\n\n\"I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of the\ncottagers greatly endeared them to me: when they were unhappy, I felt\ndepressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw few\nhuman beings beside them; and if any other happened to enter the\ncottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the\nsuperior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive,\noften endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that\nhe called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a\ncheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure\neven upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled\nwith tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I\ngenerally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after\nhaving listened to the exhortations of her father.",
    "141": " It was not thus with\nFelix. He was always the saddest of the group; and, even to my\nunpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his\nfriends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more\ncheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old\nman.\n\n\"I could mention innumerable instances, which, although slight, marked\nthe dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty and\nwant, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white\nflower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in the\nmorning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed\nher path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the\nwood from the out-house, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found\nhis store always replenished by an invisible hand. In the day, I\nbelieve, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he often\nwent forth, and did not return until dinner, yet brought no wood with\nhim. At other times he worked in the garden; but, as there was little to\ndo in the frosty season, he read to the old man and Agatha.\n\n\"This reading had puzzled me extremely at first; but, by degrees, I\ndiscovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read, as when\nhe talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs\nfor speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend\nthese als",
    "142": "o; but how was that possible, when I did not even understand\nthe sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however, sensibly\nin this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of\nconversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour: for I\neasily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to\nthe cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become\nmaster of their language; which knowledge might enable me to make them\noverlook the deformity of my figure; for with this also the contrast\nperpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.\n\n\"I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers--their grace, beauty,\nand delicate complexions: but how was I terrified, when I viewed myself\nin a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that\nit was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully\nconvinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with\nthe bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification. Alas! I did\nnot yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.\n\n\"As the sun became warmer, and the light of day longer, the snow\nvanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this\ntime Felix was more employed; and the heart-moving indications of\nimpending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was\ncoarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.",
    "143": "\nSeveral new kinds of plants sprung up in the garden, which they dressed;\nand these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced.\n\n\"The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did\nnot rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its\nwaters. This frequently took place; but a high wind quickly dried the\nearth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.\n\n\"My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning, I\nattended the motions of the cottagers; and when they were dispersed in\nvarious occupations, I slept: the remainder of the day was spent in\nobserving my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any\nmoon, or the night was star-light, I went into the woods, and collected\nmy own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it\nwas necessary, I cleared their path from the snow, and performed those\noffices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these\nlabours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and\nonce or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good_\n_spirit_, _wonderful_; but I did not then understand the signification\nof these terms.\n\n\"My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the\nmotives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to\nknow why Felix appeared so miserable, and Agatha so sad.",
    "144": " I thought\n(foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to\nthese deserving people. When I slept, or was absent, the forms of the\nvenerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix,\nflitted before me. I looked upon them as superior beings, who would be\nthe arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination a thousand\npictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me. I\nimagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and\nconciliating words, I should first win their favour, and afterwards\ntheir love.\n\n\"These thoughts exhilarated me, and led me to apply with fresh ardour to\nthe acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but\nsupple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their\ntones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.\nIt was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose\nintentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved\nbetter treatment than blows and execration.\n\n\"The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the\naspect of the earth. Men, who before this change seemed to have been hid\nin caves, dispersed themselves, and were employed in various arts of\ncultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began\nto bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! fit habitation for gods,\nwhich, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. My\nspirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past\nwas blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future\ngilded by bright rays of hope, and anticipations of joy.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\n\"I now hasten to the more moving part of my story.",
    "145": " I shall relate\nevents, that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been,\nhave made me what I am.\n\n\"Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine, and the skies\ncloudless. It surprised me, that what before was desert and gloomy\nshould now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My senses\nwere gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight, and a\nthousand sights of beauty.\n\n\"It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from\nlabour--the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to\nhim--that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond\nexpression; he sighed frequently; and once his father paused in his\nmusic, and I conjectured by his manner that he enquired the cause of his\nson's sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was\nrecommencing his music, when some one tapped at the door.\n\n\"It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a countryman as a guide. The\nlady was dressed in a dark suit, and covered with a thick black veil.\nAgatha asked a question; to which the stranger only replied by\npronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix.",
    "146": " Her voice was\nmusical, but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word,\nFelix came up hastily to the lady; who, when she saw him, threw up her\nveil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her\nhair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were\ndark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular\nproportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a\nlovely pink.\n\n\"Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of\nsorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of\necstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes\nsparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I\nthought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by\ndifferent feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held\nout her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously, and called her, as\nwell as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to\nunderstand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and dismissing\nher guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some conversation took place\nbetween him and his father; and the young stranger knelt at the old\nman's feet, and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her, and\nembraced her affectionately.",
    "147": "\n\n\"I soon perceived, that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds,\nand appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood\nby, nor herself understood, the cottagers. They made many signs which I\ndid not comprehend; but I saw that her presence diffused gladness\nthrough the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the\nmorning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy, and with smiles of delight\nwelcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands\nof the lovely stranger; and, pointing to her brother, made signs which\nappeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. Some\nhours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the\ncause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I found, by the frequent\nrecurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them, that\nshe was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly\noccurred to me, that I should make use of the same instructions to the\nsame end. The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson,\nmost of them, indeed, were those which I had before understood, but I\nprofited by the others.",
    "148": "\n\n\"As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they\nseparated, Felix kissed the hand of the stranger, and said, 'Good night,\nsweet Safie.' He sat up much longer, conversing with his father; and, by\nthe frequent repetition of her name, I conjectured that their lovely\nguest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to\nunderstand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found\nit utterly impossible.\n\n\"The next morning Felix went out to his work; and, after the usual\noccupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the\nold man, and, taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly\nbeautiful, that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my\neyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or\ndying away, like a nightingale of the woods.\n\n\"When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first\ndeclined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in\nsweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old\nman appeared enraptured, and said some words, which Agatha endeavoured\nto explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that\nshe bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.\n\n\"The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration,\nthat joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.\nSafie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the\nknowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most\nof the words uttered by my protectors.\n\n\"In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and\nthe green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sw",

I should not have understood the purport of this book, had not\nFelix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this\nwork, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of\nthe eastern authors.",
    "150": " Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of\nhistory, and a view of the several empires at present existing in the\nworld; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and\nreligions of the different nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful\nAsiatics; of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians;\nof the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans--of their\nsubsequent degenerating--of the decline of that mighty empire; of\nchivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard of the discovery of the\nAmerican hemisphere, and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its\noriginal inhabitants.\n\n\"These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man,\nindeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous, and magnificent, yet so\nvicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil\nprinciple, and at another, as all that can be conceived of noble and\ngodlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that\ncan befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record\nhave ",

For a long time I could not\nconceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why\nthere were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and\nbloodshed, my wonder ceased, and I turned away with disgust and\nloathing.\n\n\"Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.\nWhile I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the\nArabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I\nheard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid\npoverty; of rank, descent, and noble blood.\n\n\"The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the\npossessions most esteemed by your fellow-creatures were, high and\nunsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with only\none of these advantages; but, without either, he was considered, except\nin very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his\npowers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I? Of my creation\nand creator I was absolutely ignorant; but I knew that I possessed no\nmoney, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides, endued with a\nfigure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same\nnature as man.",
    "152": " I was more agile than they, and could subsist upon\ncoarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to\nmy frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked around, I saw\nand heard of none like me. Was I then a monster, a blot upon the earth,\nfrom which all men fled, and whom all men disowned?\n\n\"I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted\nupon me: I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with\nknowledge. Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor known\nnor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!\n\n\"Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind, when it\nhas once seized on it, like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to\nshake off all thought and feeling; but I learned that there was but one\nmeans to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death--a state\nwhich I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good\nfeelings, and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my\ncottagers; but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except through\nmeans which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and\nwhich rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming one\namong my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha, and the animated smiles\nof the charming Arabian, were not for me. The mild exhortations of the\nold man, and the lively conversation of the loved Felix, were not for\nme. Miserable, unhappy wretch!\n\n\"Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply.",
    "153": " I heard of the\ndifference of sexes; and the birth and growth of children; how the\nfather doated on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the\nolder child; how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in\nthe precious charge; how the mind of youth expanded and gained\nknowledge; of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which\nbind one human being to another in mutual bonds.\n\n\"But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my\ninfant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if\nthey had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I\ndistinguished nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then\nwas in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a being resembling\nme, or who claimed any intercourse with me. What was I? The question\nagain recurred, to be answered only with groans.\n\n\"I will soon explain to what these feelings tended; but allow me now to\nreturn to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings\nof indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in\nadditional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an\ninnocent, half painful self-deceit, to call them).\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n\n\"Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was\none which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding\nas it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to\none so utterly inexperienced as I was.\n\n\"The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good\nfamily in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence,\nrespected by his superiors, and beloved by his equals.",
    "154": " His son was bred\nin the service of his country; and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the\nhighest distinction. A few months before my arrival, they had lived in a\nlarge and luxurious city, called Paris, surrounded by friends, and\npossessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or\ntaste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.\n\n\"The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a Turkish\nmerchant, and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some reason\nwhich I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government. He was\nseized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from\nConstantinople to join him. He was tried, and condemned to death. The\ninjustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant;\nand it was judged that his religion and wealth, rather than the crime\nalleged against him, had been the cause of his condemnation.\n\n\"Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and\nindignation were uncontrollable, when he heard the decision of the\ncourt. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him, and then\nlooked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain\nadmittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an\nunguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeo",
    "155": "n of the\nunfortunate Mahometan; who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the\nexecution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at night,\nand made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk,\namazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by\npromises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with contempt;\nyet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit her father,\nand who, by her gestures, expressed her lively gratitude, the youth\ncould not help owning to his own mind, that the captive possessed a\ntreasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.\n\n\"The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on\nthe heart of Felix, and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his\ninterests by the promise of her hand in marriage, so soon as he should\nbe conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was too delicate to accept this\noffer; yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the\nconsummation of his happiness.\n\n\"During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for\nthe escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several\nletters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to\nexpress her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old\nman, a servant of her father, who understood French. She thanked him in\nthe most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent; and\nat the same time she gently deplored her own fate.",
    "156": "\n\n\"I have copies of these letters; for I found means, during my residence\nin the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were\noften in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart, I will give them\nto you, they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present, as the sun\nis already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat the substance\nof them to you.\n\n\"Safie related, that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a\nslave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of\nthe father of Safie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high and\nenthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the\nbondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in the\ntenets of her religion, and taught her to aspire to higher powers of\nintellect, and an independence of spirit, forbidden to the female\nfollowers of Mahomet. This lady died; but her lessons were indelibly\nimpressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again\nreturning to Asia, and being immured within the walls of a haram,\nallowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill suited to\nthe temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble\nemulation for virtue.",
    "157": " The prospect of marrying a Christian, and\nremaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in\nsociety, was enchanting to her.\n\n\"The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed; but, on the night\nprevious to it, he quitted his prison, and before morning was distant\nmany leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name of his\nfather, sister, and himself. He had previously communicated his plan to\nthe former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under the\npretence of a journey, and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an\nobscure part of Paris.\n\n\"Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons, and across Mont\nCenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable\nopportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.\n\n\"Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his\ndeparture, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she\nshould be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in\nexpectation of that event; and in the mean time he enjoyed the society\nof the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest\naffection. They conversed with one another through the means of an\ninterpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie\nsang to him the divine airs of her native country.\n\n\"The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place, and encouraged the hopes\nof the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other\nplans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a\nChristian; but he feared the resentment of Felix, if he should appear\nlukewarm; for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer,\nif he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they\ninhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to\nprolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly\nto take his daughter with him when he departed.",
    "158": " His plans were\nfacilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.\n\n\"The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their\nvictim, and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The plot\nof Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown\ninto prison. The news reached Felix, and roused him from his dream of\npleasure. His blind and aged father, and his gentle sister, lay in a\nnoisome dungeon, while he enjoyed the free air, and the society of her\nwhom he loved. This idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged with\nthe Turks, that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for\nescape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a\nboarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian,\nhe hastened to Paris, and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the\nlaw, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.\n\n\"He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the\ntrial took place; the result of which deprived them of their fortune,\nand condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.\n\n\"They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I\ndiscovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom\nhe and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering\nthat his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin, became a\ntraitor to good feeling and honour, and had quitted Italy with his\ndaughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money, to aid him, as\nhe said, in some plan of future maintenance.\n\n\"Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix, and rendered\nhim, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family.",
    "159": " He could\nhave endured poverty; and while this distress had been the meed of his\nvirtue, he gloried in it: but the ingratitude of the Turk, and the loss\nof his beloved Safie, were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The\narrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.\n\n\"When the news reached Leghorn, that Felix was deprived of his wealth\nand rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her\nlover, but to prepare to return to her native country. The generous\nnature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to\nexpostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his\ntyrannical mandate.\n\n\"A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter's apartment, and told\nher hastily, that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn\nhad been divulged, and that he should speedily be delivered up to the\nFrench government; he had, consequently hired a vessel to convey him to\nConstantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. He\nintended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant,\nto follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property, which\nhad not yet arrived at Leghorn.\n\n\"When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it\nwould become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey was\nabhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike adverse to\nit. By some papers of her father, which fell into her hands, she heard\nof the exile of her lover, and learnt the name of the spot where he then\nresided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her\ndetermination. Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her, and a\nsum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn,\nbut who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for\nGermany.\n\n\"She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage\nof De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill.",
    "160": " Safie nursed her\nwith the most devoted affection; but the poor girl died, and the Arabian\nwas left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country, and\nutterly ignorant of the customs of the world. She fell, however, into\ngood hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which\nthey were bound; and, after her death, the woman of the house in which\nthey had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at the\ncottage of her lover.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\n\"Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply. I\nlearned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire\ntheir virtues, and to deprecate the vices of mankind.\n\n\"As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil; benevolence and\ngenerosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to\nbecome an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were\ncalled forth and displayed. But, in giving an account of the progress of\nmy intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the\nbeginning of the month of August of the same year.\n\n\"One night, during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood, where I\ncollected my own food, and brought home firing for my protect",
    "161": "ors, I\nfound on the ground a leathern portmanteau, containing several articles\nof dress and some books. I eagerly seized the prize, and returned with\nit to my hovel. Fortunately the books were written in the language, the\nelements of which I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of\n'Paradise Lost,' a volume of 'Plutarch's Lives,' and the 'Sorrows of\nWerter.' The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I\nnow continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories,\nwhilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations.\n\n\"I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced\nin me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me\nto ecstacy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In\nthe 'Sorrows of Werter,' besides the interest of its simple and\naffecting story, so many opinions are canvassed, and so many lights\nthrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects, that I found\nin it a never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle\nand domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and\nfeelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded\nwell with my experience among my protectors, and with the wants which\nwere for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a more\ndivine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character contained\nno pretension, but it sunk deep. The disquisitions upon death and\nsuicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not pretend to\nenter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards the opinions\nof the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely understanding\nit.\n\n\"As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and\ncondition.",
    "162": " I found myself similar, yet at the same time strangely unlike\nto the beings concerning whom I read, and to whose conversation I was a\nlistener. I sympathised with, and partly understood them, but I was\nunformed in mind; I was dependent on none, and related to none. 'The\npath of my departure was free;' and there was none to lament my\nannihilation. My person was hideous, and my stature gigantic? What did\nthis mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my\ndestination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to\nsolve them.\n\n\"The volume of 'Plutarch's Lives,' which I possessed, contained the\nhistories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book had\na far different effect upon me from the 'Sorrows of Werter.' I learned\nfrom Werter's imaginations despondency and gloom: but Plutarch taught me\nhigh thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own\nreflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many things I\nread surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very confused\nknowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and\nboundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns, and large\nassemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the only\nschool in which I had studied human nature; but this book developed new\nand mightier scenes of action.",
    "163": " I read of men concerned in public\naffairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the greatest\nardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I\nunderstood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as I\napplied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these feelings, I\nwas of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa, Solon, and\nLycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The patriarchal lives of\nmy protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind;\nperhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young\nsoldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should have been imbued with\ndifferent sensations.\n\n\"But 'Paradise Lost' excited different and far deeper emotions. I read\nit, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as\na true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe, that the\npicture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of\nexciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity\nstruck me, to my own.",
    "164": " Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to\nany other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine\nin every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a\nperfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of\nhis Creator; he was allowed to converse with, and acquire knowledge\nfrom, beings of a superior nature: but I was wretched, helpless, and\nalone. Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my\ncondition; for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my\nprotectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me.\n\n\"Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon\nafter my arrival in the hovel, I discovered some papers in the pocket of\nthe dress which I had taken from your laboratory.

God, in pity, made\nman beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy\ntype of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance. Satan had his\ncompanions, fellow-devils, to admire and encourage him; but I am\nsolitary and abhorred.'\n\n\"These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude; but\nwhen I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and\nbenevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should become\nacquainted with my admiration of their virtues, they would compassionate\nme, and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn from their door\none, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion and friendship? I\nresolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way to fit myself for\nan interview with them which would decide my fate. I postponed this\nattempt for some months longer; for the importance attached to its\nsuccess inspired me with a dread lest I should fail. Besides, I found\nthat my understanding improved so much with every day's experience, that\nI was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months\nshould have added to my sagacity.",
    "166": "\n\n\"Several changes, in the mean time, took place in the cottage. The\npresence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants; and I also\nfound that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha\nspent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in\ntheir labours by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were\ncontented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while mine\nbecame every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only discovered\nto me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I cherished hope, it\nis true; but it vanished, when I beheld my person reflected in water, or\nmy shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail image and that inconstant\nshade.\n\n\"I endeavoured to crush these fears, and to fortify myself for the trial\nwhich in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my\nthoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and\ndared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my\nfeelings, and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed\nsmiles of consolation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my\nsorrows, nor shared my thoughts; I was alone.",
    "167": " I remembered Adam's\nsupplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me\nand, in the bitterness of my heart, I cursed him.\n\n\"Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay\nand fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had\nworn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did not\nheed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my\nconformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief delights\nwere the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay apparel of\nsummer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention towards the\ncottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer.\nThey loved, and sympathised with one another; and their joys, depending\non each other, were not interrupted by the casualties that took place\naround them. The more I saw of them, the greater became my desire to\nclaim their protection and kindness; my heart yearned to be known and\nloved by these amiable creatures: to see their sweet looks directed\ntowards me with affection, was the utmost limit of my ambition.",
    "168": " I dared\nnot think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror. The\npoor that stopped at their door were never driven away. I asked, it is\ntrue, for greater treasures than a little food or rest: I required\nkindness and sympathy; but I did not believe myself utterly unworthy of\nit.\n\n\"The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken\nplace since I awoke into life. My attention, at this time, was solely\ndirected towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my\nprotectors. I revolved many projects; but that on which I finally fixed\nwas, to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone. I had\nsagacity enough to discover, that the unnatural hideousness of my person\nwas the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me. My\nvoice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I thought, therefore,\nthat if, in the absence of his children, I could gain the good-will and\nmediation of the old De Lacey, I might, by his means, be tolerated by my\nyounger protectors.\n\n\"One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground,\nand diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha, and\nFelix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own\ndesire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed,\nhe took up his guitar, and played several mournful but sweet airs, more\nsweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his\ncountenance was illuminated with pleasure, but, as he continued,\nthoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the\ninstrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.",
    "169": "\n\n\"My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which would\ndecide my hopes, or realise my fears. The servants were gone to a\nneighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage: it was an\nexcellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my\nlimbs failed me, and I sank to the ground. Again I rose; and, exerting\nall the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had\nplaced before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived me,\nand, with renewed determination, I approached the door of their cottage.\n\n\"I knocked. 'Who is there?' said the old man--'Come in.'\n\n\"I entered; 'Pardon this intrusion,' said I: 'I am a traveller in want\nof a little rest; you would greatly oblige me, if you would allow me to\nremain a few minutes before the fire.'\n\n\"'Enter,' said De Lacey; 'and I will try in what manner I can relieve\nyour wants; but, unfortunately, my children are from home, and, as I am\nblind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you.'\n\n\"'Do not trouble yourself, my kind host, I have food; it is warmth and\nrest only that I need.",
    "170": "'\n\n\"I sat down, and a silence ensued.

I am now going to claim the protection of some friends,\nwhom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.'\n\n\"'Are they Germans?'\n\n\"'No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an\nunfortunate and deserted creature; I look around, and I have no relation\nor friend upon earth.

I am blind, and cannot judge of your countenance, but\nthere is something in your words, which persuades me that you are\nsincere. I am poor, and an exile; but it will afford me true pleasure to\nbe in any way serviceable to a human creature.'\n\n\"'Excellent man! I thank you, and accept your generous offer. You raise\nme from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid, I\nshall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your\nfellow-creatures.'\n\n\"'Heaven forbid! even if you were really criminal; for that can only\ndrive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also am\nunfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent:\njudge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.'\n\n\"'How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips first\nhave I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall be for\never grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with\nthose friends whom I am on the point of meeting.",
    "172": "'\n\n\"'May I know the names and residence of those friends?'\n\n\"I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to rob\nme of, or bestow happiness on me for ever. I struggled vainly for\nfirmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my\nremaining strength; I sank on the chair, and sobbed aloud. At that\nmoment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment to\nlose; but, seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, 'Now is the\ntime!--save and protect me! You and your family are the friends whom I\nseek. Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!'\n\n\"'Great God!' exclaimed the old man, 'who are you?'\n\n\"At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and\nAgatha entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on\nbeholding me? Agatha fainted; and Safie, unable to attend to her friend,\nrushed out of the cottage. Felix darted forward, and with supernatural\nforce tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung: in a transport of\nfury, he dashed me to the ground, and struck me violently with a stick.",

Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I not\nextinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed? I\nknow not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were\nthose of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have destroyed the\ncottage and its inhabitants, and have glutted myself with their shrieks\nand misery.\n\n\"When night came, I quitted my retreat, and wandered in the wood; and\nnow, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my\nanguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken the\ntoils; destroying the objects that obstructed me, and ranging through\nthe wood with a stag-like swiftness. O! what a miserable night I passed!\nthe cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees waved their branches\nabove me: now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the\nuniversal stillness.",
    "174": " All, save I, were at rest or in enjoyment: I, like\nthe arch-fiend, bore a hell within me; and, finding myself unsympathised\nwith, wished to tear up the trees, spread havoc and destruction around\nme, and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin.\n\n\"But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became\nfatigued with excess of bodily exertion, and sank on the damp grass in\nthe sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men\nthat existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness\ntowards my enemies? No: from that moment I declared everlasting war\nagainst the species, and, more than all, against him who had formed me,\nand sent me forth to this insupportable misery.\n\n\"The sun rose; I heard the voices of men, and knew that it was\nimpossible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid\nmyself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours\nto reflection on my situation.\n\n\"The pleasant sunshine, and the pure air of day, restored me to some\ndegree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the\ncottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my\nconclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that my\nconversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a fool in\nhaving exposed my person to the horror of his children.",
    "175": " I ought to have\nfamiliarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to have discovered\nmyself to the rest of his family, when they should have been prepared\nfor my approach. But I did not believe my errors to be irretrievable;\nand, after much consideration, I resolved to return to the cottage, seek\nthe old man, and by my representations win him to my party.\n\n\"These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound\nsleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by\npeaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever\nacting before my eyes; the females were flying, and the enraged Felix\ntearing me from his father's feet. I awoke exhausted; and, finding that\nit was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in\nsearch of food.\n\n\"When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the well-known\npath that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace. I crept into\nmy hovel, and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when\nthe family arose. That hour passed, the sun mounted high in the heavens,\nbut the cottagers did not appear. I trembled violently, apprehending\nsome dreadful misfortune. The inside of the cottage was dark, and I\nheard no motion; I cannot describe the agony of this suspense.\n\n\"Presently two countrymen passed by; but, pausing near the cottage, they\nentered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not\nunderstand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,\nwhich differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix\napproached with another man: I was surprised, as I knew that he had not\nquitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover, from\nhis discourse, the meaning of these unusual appearances.",
    "176": "\n\n\"'Do you consider,' said his companion to him, 'that you will be\nobliged to pay three months' rent, and to lose the produce of your\ngarden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and I beg therefore\nthat you will take some days to consider of your determination.'\n\n\"'It is utterly useless,' replied Felix; 'we can never again inhabit\nyour cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing to\nthe dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and my sister\nwill never recover their horror. I entreat you not to reason with me any\nmore. Take possession of your tenement, and let me fly from this place.'\n\n\"Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion entered\nthe cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then\ndeparted. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.\n\n\"I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of\nutter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed, and had broken the\nonly link that held me to the world. For the first time the feelings of\nrevenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to control\nthem; but, allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent my\nmind towards injury and death. When I thought of my friends, of the mild\nvoice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the exquisite beauty\nof the Arabian, these thoughts vanished, and a gush of tears somewhat\nsoothed me. But again, when I reflected that they had spurned and\ndeserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger; and, unable to injure any\nthing human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As night\nadvanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage; and,\nafter having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I\nwaited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my\noperations.",
    "177": "\n\n\"As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods, and quickly\ndispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens: the blast tore\nalong like a mighty avalanche, and produced a kind of insanity in my\nspirits, that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the\ndry branch of a tree, and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,\nmy eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon\nnearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my\nbrand; it sunk, and, with a loud scream, I fired the straw, and heath,\nand bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the\ncottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it, and\nlicked it with their forked and destroying tongues.\n\n\"As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of\nthe habitation, I quitted the scene, and sought for refuge in the woods.\n\n\"And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I\nresolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated\nand despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the\nthought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you were\nmy father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness than\nto him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had bestowed\nupon Safie, geography had not",
    "178": " been omitted: I had learned from these the\nrelative situations of the different countries of the earth. You had\nmentioned Geneva as the name of your native town; and towards this place\nI resolved to proceed.\n\n\"But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a\nsouth-westerly direction to reach my destination; but the sun was my\nonly guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass\nthrough, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I\ndid not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although\ntowards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling, heartless\ncreator! you had endowed me with perceptions and passions, and then cast\nme abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind. But on you only\nhad I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I determined to seek\nthat justice which I vainly attempted to gain from any other being that\nwore the human form.\n\n\"My travels were long, and the sufferings I endured intense. It was late\nin autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided. I\ntravelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human\nbeing. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and\nsnow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the\nearth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh, earth!\nhow often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The mildness\nof my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall and\nbitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more deeply\ndid I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart.",
    "179": " Snow fell, and\nthe waters were hardened; but I rested not. A few incidents now and then\ndirected me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I often wandered\nwide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite: no\nincident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its\nfood; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of\nSwitzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth, and the earth again\nbegan to look green, confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and\nhorror of my feelings.\n\n\"I generally rested during the day, and travelled only when I was\nsecured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding\nthat my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey\nafter the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,\ncheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of\nthe air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long\nappeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty of these\nsensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them; and, forgetting\nmy solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears again bedewed\nmy cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the\nblessed sun which bestowed such joy upon me.\n\n\"I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its\nboundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many\nof the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.\nHere I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard the\nsound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a\ncypress.",
    "180": " I was scarcely hid, when a young girl came running towards the\nspot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from some one in\nsport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides of the\nriver, when suddenly her foot slipt, and she fell into the rapid\nstream. I rushed from my hiding-place; and, with extreme labour from the\nforce of the current, saved her, and dragged her to shore. She was\nsenseless; and I endeavoured, by every means in my power, to restore\nanimation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,\nwho was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On seeing\nme, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms, hastened\ntowards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I hardly knew\nwhy; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he\ncarried, at my body, and fired. I sunk to the ground, and my injurer,\nwith increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.\n\n\"This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being\nfrom destruction, and, as a recompense, I now writhed under the\nmiserable pain of a wound, which shattered the flesh and bone. The\nfeelings of kindness and gentleness, which I had entertained but a few\nmoments before, gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth.\nInflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind.\nBut the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.\n\n\"For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to\ncure the wound which I had received.",
    "181": " The ball had entered my shoulder,\nand I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any\nrate I had no means of extracting it.

The\nlabours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or\ngentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery, which insulted my\ndesolate state, and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for\nthe enjoyment of pleasure.\n\n\"But my toils now drew near a close; and, in two months from this time,\nI reached the environs of Geneva.\n\n\"It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among\nthe fields that surround it, to meditate in what manner I should apply\nto you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger, and far too unhappy to\nenjoy the gentle breezes of evening, or the prospect of the sun setting\nbehind the stupendous mountains of Jura.\n\n\"At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,\nwhich was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came\nrunning into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of\ninfancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me, that this\nlittle creature was unprejudiced, and had lived too short a time to have\nimbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him, and\neducate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in\nthis peopled earth.\n\n\"Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed, and drew him\ntowards me.",

    "183": "'\n\n\"As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his\nbreast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite\nof my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I gazed\nwith delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely\nlips; but presently my rage returned: I remembered that I was for ever\ndeprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow; and\nthat she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in regarding me, have\nchanged that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and\naffright.\n\n\"Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only\nwonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in\nexclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind, and perish in the\nattempt to destroy them.\n\n\"While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had\ncommitted the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I\nentered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was\nsleeping on some straw; she was young: not indeed so beautiful as her\nwhose portrait I held; but of an agreeable aspect, and blooming in the\nloveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose\njoy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over\nher, and whispered 'Awake, fairest, thy lover is near--he who would give\nhis life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes: my\nbeloved, awake!'\n\n\"The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me.

But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable\nbarriers to our union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject\nslavery. I will revenge my injuries: if I cannot inspire love, I will\ncause fear; and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator,\ndo I swear inextinguishable hatred. Have a care: I will work at your\ndestruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall\ncurse the hour of your birth.",
    "186": "\"\n\nA fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into\ncontortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he\ncalmed himself and proceeded--\n\n\"I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me; for you do not\nreflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess. If any being felt\nemotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them an hundred and\nan hundred fold; for that one creature's sake, I would make peace with\nthe whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be\nrealised. What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a\ncreature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is\nsmall, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is\ntrue, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that\naccount we shall be more attached to one another. Our lives will not be\nhappy, but they will be harmless, and free from the misery I now feel.\nOh! my creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one\nbenefit! Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing;\ndo not deny me my request!\"\n\nI was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of\nmy consent; but I felt that there was some justice in his argument. His\ntale, and the feelings he now expressed, proved him to be a creature of\nfine sensations; and did I not as his maker, owe him all the portion of\nhappiness that it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change of\nfeeling, and continued--\n\n\"If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us\nagain: I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is not that\nof man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite;\nacorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will\nbe of the same nature as myself, and will be content with the same fare.",
    "187": "\nWe shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on\nman, and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful\nand human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the\nwantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me, I\nnow see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment, and\npersuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.\"\n\n\"You propose,\" replied I, \"to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell\nin those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only\ncompanions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man,\npersevere in this exile? You will return, and again seek their kindness,\nand you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be\nrenewed, and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of\ndestruction. This may not be: cease to argue the point, for I cannot\nconsent.\"\n\n\"How inconstant are your feelings! but a moment ago you were moved by my\nrepresentations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?\nI swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me,\nthat, with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of\nman, and dwell as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil\npassions will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! my life will\nflow quietly away, and, in my dying moments, I shall not curse my\nmaker.\"\n\nHis words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him, and\nsometimes felt a wish to console him; but when I looked upon him, when I\nsaw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened, and my\nfeelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle\nthese sensations; I thought, that as I could not sympathise with him, I\nhad no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which\nwas yet in my power to bestow.",
    "188": "\n\n\"You swear,\" I said, \"to be harmless; but have you not already shown a\ndegree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you? May not\neven this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a\nwider scope for your revenge.\"\n\n\"How is this? I must not be trifled with: and I demand an answer. If I\nhave no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion; the\nlove of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall become\na thing, of whose existence every one will be ignorant. My vices are the\nchildren of a forced solitude that I abhor; and my virtues will\nnecessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel\nthe affections of a sensitive being, and become linked to the chain of\nexistence and events, from which I am now excluded.\"\n\nI paused some time to reflect on all he had related, and the various\narguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues\nwhich he had displayed on the opening of his existence, and the\nsubsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which\nhis protectors had manifested towards him. His power and threats were\nnot omitted in my calculations: a creature who could exist in the\nice-caves of the glaciers, and hide himself from pursuit among the\nridges of inaccessible precipices, was a being possessing faculties it\nwould be vain to cope with. After a long pause of reflection, I\nconcluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow-creatures\ndemanded of me that I should comply with his request. Turning to him,\ntherefore, I said--\n\n\"I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever,\nand every othe",

Depart to your home, and\ncommence your labours: I shall watch their progress with unutterable\nanxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall appear.\"\n\nSaying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in\nmy sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than\nthe flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the\nsea of ice.\n\nHis tale had occupied the whole day; and the sun was upon the verge of\nthe horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent\ntowards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my\nheart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the\nlittle paths of the mountains, and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced,\nperplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of\nthe day had produced. Night was far advanced, when I came to the\nhalf-way resting-place, and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars\nshone at intervals, as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines\nrose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the\nground: it was a scene of wonderful solemnity, and stirred strange\nthoughts within me. I wept bitterly; and clasping my hands in agony, I\nexclaimed, \"Oh! stars and clouds, and winds, ye are all about to mock\nme: if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as\nnought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.\"\n\nThese were wild and miserable thoughts; but I cannot describe to you how\nthe eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me, and how I listened\nto every blast of wind, as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to\nconsume me.",
    "190": "\n\nMorning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no\nrest, but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could\ngive no expression to my sensations--they weighed on me with a\nmountain's weight, and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.\nThus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the\nfamily. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm; but I\nanswered no question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed\nunder a ban--as if I had no right to claim their sympathies--as if never\nmore might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I loved them\nto adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate myself to my most\nabhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation made every other\ncircumstance of existence pass before me like a dream; and that thought\nonly had to me the reality of life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\nDay after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and\nI could not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the\nvengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my\nrepugnance to the task which was enjoined me.",
    "191": " I found that I could not\ncompose a female without again devoting several months to profound study\nand laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries having been\nmade by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was material to\nmy success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father's consent to\nvisit England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay,\nand shrunk from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate\nnecessity began to appear less absolute to me. A change indeed had taken\nplace in me: my health, which had hitherto declined, was now much\nrestored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy\npromise, rose proportionably. My father saw this change with pleasure,\nand he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the\nremains of my melancholy, which every now and then would return by fits,\nand with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At\nthese moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole\ndays on the lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds, and\nlistening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the\nfresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of\ncomposure; and, on my return, I met the salutations of my friends with a\nreadier smile and a more cheerful heart.",
    "192": "\n\nIt was after my return from one of these rambles, that my father,\ncalling me aside, thus addressed me:--\n\n\"I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former\npleasures, and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still\nunhappy, and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in\nconjecture as to the cause of this; but yesterday an idea struck me, and\nif it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a point\nwould be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.\"\n\nI trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued--\n\n\"I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage\nwith our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort, and the stay\nof my declining years. You were attached to each other from your\nearliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions\nand tastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the\nexperience of man, that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my\nplan, may have entirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your\nsister, without any wish that she might become your wife.",
    "193": " Nay, you may\nhave met with another whom you may love; and, considering yourself as\nbound in honour to Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant\nmisery which you appear to feel.\"\n\n\"My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and\nsincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my\nwarmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are\nentirely bound up in the expectation of our union.\"\n\n\"The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor,\ngives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you\nfeel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast\na gloom over us. But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so\nstrong a hold of your mind, that I wish to dissipate. Tell me,\ntherefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the\nmarriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us\nfrom that every-day tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities.",
    "194": " You\nare younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent\nfortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future\nplans of honour and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose,\nhowever, that I wish to dictate happiness to you, or that a delay on\nyour part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words with\ncandour, and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and sincerity.\"\n\nI listened to my father in silence, and remained for some time incapable\nof offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of\nthoughts, and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! to me the\nidea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and\ndismay. I was bound by a solemn promise, which I had not yet fulfilled,\nand dared not break; or, if I did, what manifold miseries might not\nimpend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival with\nthis deadly weight yet hanging round my neck, and bowing me to the\nground. I must perform my engagement, and let the monster depart with\nhis mate, before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of an union from\nwhich I expected peace.\n\nI remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to\nEngland, or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers\nof that country, whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable\nuse to me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining the\ndesired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory: besides, I had an\ninsurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome\ntask in my father's house, while in habits of familiar intercourse with\nthose I loved.",
    "195": " I knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur, the\nslightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me\nwith horror. I was aware also that I should often lose all self-command,\nall capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me\nduring the progress of my unearthly occupation. I must absent myself\nfrom all I loved while thus employed. Once commenced, it would quickly\nbe achieved, and I might be restored to my family in peace and\nhappiness. My promise fulfilled, the monster would depart for ever. Or\n(so my fond fancy imaged) some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy\nhim, and put an end to my slavery for ever.\n\nThese feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to\nvisit England; but, concealing the true reasons of this request, I\nclothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I\nurged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to\ncomply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy, that\nresembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find that\nI was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey, and he\nhoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my return,\nhave restored me entirely to myself.",
    "196": "\n\nThe duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or\nat most a year, was the period contemplated. One paternal kind\nprecaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without\npreviously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,\narranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered with\nthe solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the\ncommencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be\nan impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many\nhours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between me\nand the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times\nforce his abhorred presence on me, to remind me of my task, or to\ncontemplate its progress?\n\nTo England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union\nwith Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My father's\nage rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one\nreward I promised myself from my detested toils--one consolation for my\nunparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,\nenfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth, and\nforget the past in my union with her.\n\nI now made arrangements for my journey; but one feeling haunted me,\nwhich filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I should\nleave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy, and\nunprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my\ndeparture. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go; and\nwould he not accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in\nitself, but soothing, inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.\nI was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this\nmight happen.",
    "197": " But through the whole period during which I was the slave\nof my creature, I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the\nmoment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend\nwould follow me, and exempt my family from the danger of his\nmachinations.\n\nIt was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native\ncountry. My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth,\ntherefore, acquiesced: but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of\nmy suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had\nbeen her care which provided me a companion in Clerval--and yet a man is\nblind to a thousand minute circumstances, which call forth a woman's\nsedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return,--a thousand\nconflicting emotions rendered her mute, as she bade me a tearful silent\nfarewell.\n\nI threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly\nknowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around. I\nremembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on\nit, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with\nme. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful and\nmajestic scenes; but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could only\nthink of the bourne of my travels, and the work which was to occupy me\nwhilst they endured.",
    "198": "\n\nAfter some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed\nmany leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for\nClerval. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast between us! He was\nalive to every new scene; joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting\nsun, and more happy when he beheld it rise, and recommence a new day.\nHe pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape, and the\nappearances of the sky. \"This is what it is to live,\" he cried, \"now I\nenjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you\ndesponding and sorrowful!\" In truth, I was occupied by gloomy thoughts,\nand neither saw the descent of the evening star, nor the golden sunrise\nreflected in the Rhine.--And you, my friend, would be far more amused\nwith the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an eye of\nfeeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a miserable\nwretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment.\n\nWe had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to\nRotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During this voyage,\nwe passed many willowy islands, and saw several beautiful towns. We\nstayed a day at Manheim, and, on the fifth from our departure from\nStrasburgh, arrived at Mayence. The course of the Rhine below Mayence\nbecomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly, and winds\nbetween hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw many\nruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black\nwoods, high and inaccessible.",
    "199": " This part of the Rhine, indeed, presents a\nsingularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view rugged hills,\nruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine\nrushing beneath; and, on the sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing\nvineyards, with green sloping banks, and a meandering river, and\npopulous towns occupy the scene.\n\nWe travelled at the time of the vintage, and heard the song of the\nlabourers, as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and\nmy spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased.\nI lay at the bottom of the boat, and, as I gazed on the cloudless blue\nsky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a\nstranger. And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of\nHenry? He felt as if he had been transported to Fairy-land, and enjoyed\na happiness seldom tasted by man. \"I have seen,\" he said, \"the most\nbeautiful scenes of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne\nand Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the\nwater, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy\nand mournful appearance, were it not for the most verdant islands that\nrelieve the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake agitated\nby a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water, and gave you an\nidea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean; and the waves\ndash with fury the base of the mountain, where the priest and his\nmistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche, and where their dying voices\nare still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; I have\nseen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud: but this country,\nVictor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The mountains of\nSwitzerland are more majestic and strange; but there is a charm in the\nbanks of this divine river, that I never before saw equalled.",
    "200": " Look at\nthat castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island,\nalmost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that\ngroup of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village half\nhid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely, the spirit that inhabits\nand guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man, than those\nwho pile the glacier, or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the\nmountains of our own country.\"\n\nClerval! beloved friend! even now it delights me to record your words,\nand to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He\nwas a being formed in the \"very poetry of nature.\" His wild and\nenthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart.\nHis soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of\nthat devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to\nlook for only in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not\nsufficient to satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature,\nwhich others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour:--\n\n    ----\"The sounding cataract\n    Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,\n    The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\n    Their colours and their forms, were then to him\n    An appetite; a feeling, and a love,\n    That had no need of a remoter charm,\n    By thought supplied, or any interest\n    Unborrow'd from the eye\"[3]\n\n[Footnote 3: Wordsworth's Tintern Abbey.]\n\nAnd where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost for\never? Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imagin",
    "201": "ations fanciful and\nmagnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the life\nof its creator;--has this mind perished? Does it now only exist in my\nmemory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and beaming\nwith beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and consoles your\nunhappy friend.\n\nPardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight\ntribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart,\noverflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will\nproceed with my tale.\n\nBeyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to\npost the remainder of our way; for the wind was contrary, and the stream\nof the river was too gentle to aid us.\n\nOur journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery; but\nwe arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to\nEngland. It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that\nI first saw the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames\npresented a new scene; they were flat, but fertile, and almost every\ntown was marked by the remembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort,\nand remembered the Spanish armada; Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich,\nplaces which I had heard of even in my country.\n\nAt length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul's towering\nabove all, and the Tower famed in English history.",
    "202": "\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\nLondon was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several\nmonths in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the\nintercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time;\nbut this was with me a secondary object; I was principally occupied with\nthe means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of\nmy promise, and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction\nthat I had brought with me, addressed to the most distinguished natural\nphilosophers.\n\nIf this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,\nit would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had come\nover my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the\ninformation they might give me on the subject in which my interest was\nso terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could\nfill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry\nsoothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace. But\nbusy uninteresting joyous faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw\nan insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow-men; this\nbarrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine; and to reflect\non the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.\n\nBut in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive,\nand anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of\nmanners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of\ninstruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long\nhad in view.",
    "203": " His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had in\nhis knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had taken of\nits society, the means of materially assisting the progress of European\ncolonisation and trade. In Britain only could he further the execution\nof his plan. He was for ever busy; and the only check to his enjoyments\nwas my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal this as much as\npossible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one,\nwho was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or\nbitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him, alleging another\nengagement, that I might remain alone. I now also began to collect the\nmaterials necessary for my new creation, and this was to me like the\ntorture of single drops of water continually falling on the head. Every\nthought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word\nthat I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to\npalpitate.\n\nAfter passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person\nin Scotland, who had formerly been our visiter at Geneva.",
    "204": " He mentioned\nthe beauties of his native country, and asked us if those were not\nsufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north\nas Perth, where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this\ninvitation; and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again\nmountains and streams, and all the wondrous works with which Nature\nadorns her chosen dwelling-places.\n\nWe had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now\nFebruary. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the\nnorth at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not\nintend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor,\nOxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the\ncompletion of this tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical\ninstruments, and the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my\nlabours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.\n\nWe quitted London on the 27th of March, and remained a few days at\nWindsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us\nmountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of\nstately deer, were all novelties to us.\n\nFrom thence we proceeded to Oxford.",
    "205": " As we entered this city, our minds\nwere filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted\nthere more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles I.\nhad collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him, after\nthe whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of\nparliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king, and his\ncompanions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and\nson, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city, which they\nmight be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a\ndwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these\nfeelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of the\ncity had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration. The\ncolleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost\nmagnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows\nof exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,\nwhich reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes,\nembosomed among aged trees.\n\nI enjoyed this scene; and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the\nmemory of the past, and the anticipation of the future. I was formed for\npeaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never visited my\nmind; and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what is\nbeautiful in nature, or the study of what is excellent and sublime in\nthe productions of man, could always interest my heart, and communicate\nelasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered\nmy soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit, what I shall\nsoon cease to be--a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to\nothers, and intolerable to myself.\n\nWe passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs,\nand endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most\nanimating epoch of English history.",
    "206": " Our little voyages of discovery were\noften prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. We\nvisited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden, and the field on which that\npatriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and\nmiserable fears, to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and\nself-sacrifice, of which these sights were the monuments and the\nremembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains, and look\naround me with a free and lofty spirit; but the iron had eaten into my\nflesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.\n\nWe left Oxford with regret, and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next\nplace of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village\nresembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but every\nthing is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant\nwhite Alps, which always attend on the piny mountains of my native\ncountry. We visited the wondrous cave, and the little cabinets of\nnatural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner\nas in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name made me\ntremble, when pronounced by Henry; and I hastened to quit Matlock, with\nwhich that terrible scene was thus associated.\n\nFrom Derby, still journeying northward, we passed two months in\nCumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the\nSwiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the\nnorthern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky\nstreams, were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we made some\nacquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness. The\ndelight of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind\nexpanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature\ngreater ",
    "207": "capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to\nhave possessed while he associated with his inferiors. \"I could pass my\nlife here,\" said he to me; \"and among these mountains I should scarcely\nregret Switzerland and the Rhine.\"\n\nBut he found that a traveller's life is one that includes much pain\namidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and\nwhen he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit\nthat on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again\nengages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.\n\nWe had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland,\nand conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants, when the period\nof our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them\nto travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my\npromise for some time, and I feared the effects of the d\u00e6mon's\ndisappointment. He might remain in Switzerland, and wreak his vengeance\non my relatives. This idea pursued me, and tormented me at every moment\nfrom which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited\nfor my letters with feverish impatience: if they were delayed, I was\nmiserable, and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived, and\nI saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to\nread and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed\nme, and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion. When\nthese thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment, but\nfollowed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of his\ndestroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the\nconsciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed\ndrawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.",
    "208": "\n\nI visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might\nhave interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so\nwell as Oxford: for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing\nto him. But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its\nromantic castle, and its environs, the most delightful in the world,\nArthur's Seat, St. Bernard's Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated\nhim for the change, and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But\nI was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.\n\nWe left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew's, and\nalong the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us. But\nI was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers, or enter into their\nfeelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and\naccordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland\nalone. \"Do you,\" said I, \"enjoy yourself, and let this be our\nrendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with my\nmotions, I entreat you: leave me to peace and solitude for a short time;\nand when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more\ncongenial to your own temper.\"\n\nHenry wished to dissuade me; but, seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to\nremonstrate.",
    "209": " He entreated me to write often. \"I had rather be with you,\"\nhe said, \"in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom\nI do not know: hasten then, my dear friend, to return, that I may again\nfeel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your absence.\"\n\nHaving parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of\nScotland, and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the\nmonster followed me, and would discover himself to me when I should have\nfinished, that he might receive his companion.\n\nWith this resolution I traversed the northern highlands, and fixed on\none of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a\nplace fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock, whose high\nsides were continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren,\nscarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its\ninhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy\nlimbs gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when\nthey indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured\nfrom the main land, which was about five miles distant.",
    "210": "\n\nOn the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of\nthese was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two\nrooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable\npenury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the\ndoor was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some\nfurniture, and took possession; an incident which would, doubtless, have\noccasioned some surprise, had not all the senses of the cottagers been\nbenumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at and\nunmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I\ngave; so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men.\n\nIn this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,\nwhen the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea, to\nlisten to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a\nmonotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was\nfar different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills are\ncovered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the\nplains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky; and, when troubled\nby the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant, when\ncompared to the roarings of the giant ocean.\n\nIn this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived; but,\nas I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and\nirksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my\nlaboratory for several days; and at other times I toiled day and night\nin order to complete my work.",
    "211": " It was, indeed, a filthy process in which\nI was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy\nhad blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently\nfixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the\nhorror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in cold blood, and my\nheart often sickened at the work of my hands.\n\nThus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a\nsolitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the\nactual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew\nrestless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor.\nSometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them,\nlest they should encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold.\nI feared to wander from the sight of my fellow-creatures, lest when\nalone he should come to claim his companion.\n\nIn the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably\nadvanced. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager\nhope, which I dared not trust myself to question, but which was\nintermixed with obscure forebodings of evil, that made my heart sicken\nin my bosom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n\nI sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was\njust rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment,\nand I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should\nleave my labour for the night, or hasten its conclusion by an\nunremitting attention to it.",
    "212": " As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to\nme, which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing. Three\nyears before I was engaged in the same manner, and had created a fiend\nwhose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart, and filled it for\never with the bitterest remorse. I was now about to form another being,\nof whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten\nthousand times more malignant than her mate, and delight, for its own\nsake, in murder and wretchedness. He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood\nof man, and hide himself in deserts; but she had not; and she, who in\nall probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might\nrefuse to comply with a compact made before her creation. They might\neven hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own\ndeformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it\ncame before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn with\ndisgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and\nhe be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being\ndeserted by one of his own species.\n\nEven if they were to leave Europe, and inhabit the deserts of the new\nworld, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the\nd\u00e6mon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be\npropagated upon the earth, who might make the very existence of the\nspecies of man a condition precarious and full of terror. Had I right,\nfor my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?\nI had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I\nhad been struck senseless by his fiendish threats: but now, for the\nfirst time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to\nthink that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness\nhad not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the\nexistence of the whole human race.",
    "213": "\n\nI trembled, and my heart failed within me; when, on looking up, I saw,\nby the light of the moon, the d\u00e6mon at the casement. A ghastly grin\nwrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task\nwhich he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he\nhad loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide\nand desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress, and claim the\nfulfilment of my promise.\n\nAs I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of\nmalice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my\npromise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,\ntore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me\ndestroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for\nhappiness, and, with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.\n\nI left the room, and, locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own\nheart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I\nsought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate the\ngloom, and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible\nreveries.\n\nSeveral hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;\nit was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature\nreposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone\nspecked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound\nof voices, as the fishermen called to one another.",
    "214": " I felt the silence,\nalthough I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear\nwas suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a\nperson landed close to my house.\n\nIn a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one\nendeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a\npresentiment of who it was, and wished to rouse one of the peasants who\ndwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the\nsensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you\nin vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the\nspot.\n\nPresently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door\nopened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he\napproached me, and said, in a smothered voice--\n\n\"You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you\nintend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and\nmisery: I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the\nRhine, among its willow islands, and over the summits of its hills. I\nhave dwelt many months in the heaths of England, and among the deserts\nof Scotland. I have endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger;\ndo you dare destroy my hopes?\"\n\n\"Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like\nyourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.\"\n\n\"Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself\nunworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe\nyourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day\nwill be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your\nmaster;--obey!\"\n\n\"The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is\narrived.",
    "215": " Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but\nthey confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in\nvice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a d\u00e6mon, whose\ndelight is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and your words\nwill only exasperate my rage.\"\n\nThe monster saw my determination in my face, and gnashed his teeth in\nthe impotence of anger. \"Shall each man,\" cried he, \"find a wife for his\nbosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had feelings of\naffection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn. Man! you may\nhate; but beware! your hours will pass in dread and misery, and soon the\nbolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for ever. Are\nyou to be happy, while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness?\nYou can blast my other passions; but revenge remains--revenge,\nhenceforth dearer than light or food! I may die; but first you, my\ntyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery.\nBeware; for I am fearless, and therefore powerful. I will watch with the\nwiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall\nrepent of the injuries you inflict.\"\n\n\"Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice. I\nhave declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend beneath\nwords. Leave me; I am inexorable.\"\n\n\"It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your\nwedding-night.\"\n\nI started forward, and exclaimed, \"Villain! before you sign my\ndeath-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.\"\n\nI would have seized him; but he eluded me, and quitted the house with\nprecipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot across\nthe waters with an arrowy swiftness, and was soon lost amidst the waves.\n\nAll was again silent; but his words rung in my ears. I burned with rage\nto pursue the murderer of my peace, and precipitate him into the ocean.",
    "216": "\nI walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination\nconjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not\nfollowed him, and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered\nhim to depart, and he had directed his course towards the main land. I\nshuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his\ninsatiate revenge. And then I thought again of his words--\"_I will be\nwith you on your wedding-night._\" That then was the period fixed for the\nfulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die, and at once satisfy\nand extinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet\nwhen I thought of my beloved Elizabeth,--of her tears and endless\nsorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from\nher,--tears, the first I had shed for many months, streamed from my\neyes, and I resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter\nstruggle.\n\nThe night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings\nbecame calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage\nsinks into the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of\nthe last night's contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I\nalmost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my\nfellow-creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole\nacross me. I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock,\nwearily, it is true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If\nI returned, it was to be sacrificed, or to see those whom I most loved\ndie under the grasp of a d\u00e6mon whom I had myself created.",
    "217": "\n\nI walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it\nloved, and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the sun\nrose higher, I lay down on the grass, and was overpowered by a deep\nsleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves were\nagitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep into\nwhich I now sunk refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as if I\nbelonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to reflect\nupon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the\nfiend rung in my ears like a death-knell, they appeared like a dream,\nyet distinct and oppressive as a reality.\n\nThe sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my\nappetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a\nfishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;\nit contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval, entreating me to\njoin him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he\nwas; that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired his\nreturn to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his Indian\nenterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as his\njourney to London might be followed, even sooner than he now\nconjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of\nmy society on him as I could spare.",
    "218": " He besought me, therefore, to leave\nmy solitary isle, and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed\nsouthwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and I\ndetermined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.\n\nYet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I\nshuddered to reflect: I must pack up my chemical instruments; and for\nthat purpose I must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious\nwork, and I must handle those utensils, the sight of which was sickening\nto me. The next morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage, and\nunlocked the door of my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished\ncreature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost\nfelt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to\ncollect myself, and then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I\nconveyed the instruments out of the room; but I reflected that I ought\nnot to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of\nthe peasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great\nquantity of stones, and, laying them up, determined to throw them into\nthe sea that very night; and in the mean time I sat upon the beach,\nemployed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus.",
    "219": "\n\nNothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place\nin my feelings since the night of the appearance of the d\u00e6mon. I had\nbefore regarded my promise with a gloomy despair, as a thing that, with\nwhatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film\nhad been taken from before my eyes, and that I, for the first time, saw\nclearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur\nto me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not\nreflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in\nmy own mind, that to create another like the fiend I had first made\nwould be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness; and I\nbanished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different\nconclusion.\n\nBetween two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting\nmy basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the\nshore. The scene was perfectly solitary: a few boats were returning\ntowards land, but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the\ncommission of a dreadful crime, and avoided with shuddering anxiety any\nencounter with my fellow-creatures. At one time the moon, which had\nbefore been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took\nadvantage of the moment of darkness, and cast my basket into the sea: I\nlistened to the gurgling sound as it sunk, and then sailed away from the\nspot. The sky became clouded; but the air was pure, although chilled by\nthe north-east breeze that was then rising. But it refreshed me, and\nfilled me with such agreeable sensations, that I resolved to prolong my\nstay on the water; and, fixing the rudder in a direct position,\nstretched myself at the bottom of the boat.",
    "220": " Clouds hid the moon, every\nthing was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat, as its keel\ncut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept\nsoundly.\n\nI do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I\nfound that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high,\nand the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I\nfound that the wind was north-east, and must have driven me far from the\ncoast from which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course, but\nquickly found that, if I again made the attempt, the boat would be\ninstantly filled with water. Thus situated, my only resource was to\ndrive before the wind. I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror.\nI had no compass with me, and was so slenderly acquainted with the\ngeography of this part of the world, that the sun was of little benefit\nto me. I might be driven into the wide Atlantic, and feel all the\ntortures of starvation, or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters\nthat roared and buffeted around me. I had already been out many hours,\nand felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to my other\nsufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds that\nflew before the wind, only to be replaced by others: I looked upon the\nsea, it was to be my grave.",
    "221": " \"Fiend,\" I exclaimed, \"your task is already\nfulfilled!\" I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval; all\nleft behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and\nmerciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie, so despairing\nand frightful, that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing\nbefore me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.\n\nSome hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the\nhorizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze, and the sea became\nfree from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell: I felt sick,\nand hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high\nland towards the south.\n\nAlmost spent, as I was, by fatigue, and the dreadful suspense I endured\nfor several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of\nwarm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.\n\nHow mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we\nhave of life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail\nwith a part of my dress, and eagerly steered my course towards the land.\nIt had a wild and rocky appearance; but, as I approached nearer, I\neasily perceived the traces of cultivation.",
    "222": " I saw vessels near the\nshore, and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood\nof civilised man. I carefully traced the windings of the land, and\nhailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small\npromontory. As I was in a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail\ndirectly towards the town, as a place where I could most easily procure\nnourishment. Fortunately I had money with me. As I turned the\npromontory, I perceived a small neat town and a good harbour, which I\nentered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape.\n\nAs I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several\npeople crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my\nappearance; but, instead of offering me any assistance, whispered\ntogether with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me\na slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they\nspoke English; and I therefore addressed them in that language: \"My good\nfriends,\" said I, \"will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this\ntown, and inform me where I am?\"\n\n\"You will know that soon enough,\" replied a man with a hoarse voice.\n\"May be you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste;\nbut you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.\"\n\nI was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a\nstranger; and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and\nangry countenances of his companions.",
    "223": " \"Why do you answer me so roughly?\"\nI replied; \"surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive\nstrangers so inhospitably.\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said the man, \"what the custom of the English may be;\nbut is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.\"\n\nWhile this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly\nincrease. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which\nannoyed, and in some degree alarmed me. I enquired the way to the inn;\nbut no one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose\nfrom the crowd as they followed and surrounded me; when an ill-looking\nman approaching, tapped me on the shoulder, and said, \"Come, Sir, you\nmust follow me to Mr. Kirwin's, to give an account of yourself.\"\n\n\"Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not this a\nfree country?\"\n\n\"Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate; and\nyou are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found\nmurdered here last night.\"\n\nThis answer startled me; but I presently recovered myself. I was\ninnocent; that could easily be proved: accordingly I followed my\nconductor in silence, and was led to one of the best houses in the town.\nI was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger; but, being surrounded by a\ncrowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical\ndebility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt. Little\ndid I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm\nme, and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death.\n\nI must pause here; for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory\nof the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to\nmy recollection.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n\nI was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old\nbenevolent man, with calm and mild manners.",
    "224": " He looked upon me, however,\nwith some degree of severity: and then, turning towards my conductors,\nhe asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.\n\nAbout half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the\nmagistrate, he deposed, that he had been out fishing the night before\nwith his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o'clock,\nthey observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put\nin for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen;\nthey did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a\ncreek about two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the\nfishing tackle, and his companions followed him at some distance. As he\nwas proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against something,\nand fell at his length on the ground. His companions came up to assist\nhim; and, by the light of their lantern, they found that he had fallen\non the body of a man, who was to all appearance dead. Their first\nsupposition was, that it was the corpse of some person who had been\ndrowned, and was thrown on shore by the waves; but, on examination, they\nfound that the clothes were not wet, and even that the body was not then\ncold.",
    "225": " They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the\nspot, and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it to life. It appeared\nto be a handsome young man, about five and twenty years of age. He had\napparently been strangled; for there was no sign of any violence, except\nthe black mark of fingers on his neck.\n\nThe first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me; but\nwhen the mark of the fingers was mentioned, I remembered the murder of\nmy brother, and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a\nmist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for\nsupport. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye, and of course drew\nan unfavourable augury from my manner.\n\nThe son confirmed his father's account: but when Daniel Nugent was\ncalled, he swore positively that, just before the fall of his companion,\nhe saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the\nshore; and, as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was\nthe same boat in which I had just landed.\n\nA woman deposed, that she lived near the beach, and was standing at the\ndoor of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an\nhour before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat,\nwith only one man in it, push off from that part of the shore where the\ncorpse was afterwards found.\n\nAnother woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the\nbody into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed, and rubbed\nit; and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was quite\ngone.\n\nSeveral other men were examined concerning my landing; and they agreed,\nthat, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it\nwas very probable that I had beaten about for many hours, and had been\nobliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.",
    "226": "\nBesides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body from\nanother place, and it was likely, that as I did not appear to know the\nshore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the\ntown of * * * from the place where I had deposited the corpse.\n\nMr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken\ninto the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be\nobserved what effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea\nwas probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the\nmode of the murder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by\nthe magistrate and several other persons, to the inn. I could not help\nbeing struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during\nthis eventful night; but, knowing that I had been conversing with\nseveral persons in the island I had inhabited about the time that the\nbody had been found, I was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of\nthe affair.\n\nI entered the room where the corpse lay, and was led up to the coffin.\nHow can I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched\nwith horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without\nshuddering and agony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate\nand witnesses, passed like a dream from my memory, when I saw the\nlifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me.",
    "227": " I gasped for breath;\nand, throwing myself on the body, I exclaimed, \"Have my murderous\nmachinations deprived you also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have\nalready destroyed; other victims await their destiny: but you, Clerval,\nmy friend, my benefactor----\"\n\nThe human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and\nI was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.\n\nA fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death:\nmy ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the\nmurderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated\nmy attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was\ntormented; and at others, I felt the fingers of the monster already\ngrasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately,\nas I spoke my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my\ngestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other\nwitnesses.\n\nWhy did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I\nnot sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming\nchildren, the only hopes of their doating parents: how many brides and\nyouthful lovers have been one day in",
    "228": " the bloom of health and hope, and\nthe next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials\nwas I made, that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the\nturning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture?\n\nBut I was doomed to live; and, in two months, found myself as awaking\nfrom a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by\ngaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.\nIt was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding: I had\nforgotten the particulars of what had happened, and only felt as if some\ngreat misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around,\nand saw the barred windows, and the squalidness of the room in which I\nwas, all flashed across my memory, and I groaned bitterly.\n\nThis sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me.\nShe was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her\ncountenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise\nthat class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of\npersons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her\ntone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English, and\nthe voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings:--\n\n\"Are you better now, sir?\" said she.\n\nI replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, \"I believe I am;\nbut if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am\nstill alive to feel this misery and horror.\"\n\n\"For that matter,\" replied the old woman, \"if you mean about the\ngentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you\nwere dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that's none of\nmy business; I am sent to nurse you, and get you well; I do my duty with\na safe conscience; it were well if every body did the same.",
    "229": "\"\n\nI turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a\nspeech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt\nlanguid, and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series\nof my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it\nwere all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force\nof reality.\n\nAs the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew\nfeverish; a darkness pressed around me: no one was near me who soothed\nme with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The\nphysician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them\nfor me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the\nexpression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second.\nWho could be interested in the fate of a murderer, but the hangman who\nwould gain his fee?\n\nThese were my first reflections; but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had\nshown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison to\nbe prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who had\nprovided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to see me;\nfor, although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every\nhuman creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and\nmiserable ravings of a murderer.",
    "230": " He came, therefore, sometimes, to see\nthat I was not neglected; but his visits were short, and with long\nintervals.\n\nOne day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my\neyes half open, and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome\nby gloom and misery, and often reflected I had better seek death than\ndesire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness.\nAt one time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty, and\nsuffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been.\nSuch were my thoughts, when the door of my apartment was opened, and Mr.\nKirwin entered. His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he\ndrew a chair close to mine, and addressed me in French--\n\n\"I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do any thing to\nmake you more comfortable?\"\n\n\"I thank you; but all that you mention is nothing to me: on the whole\nearth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.\"\n\n\"I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to\none borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I\nhope, soon quit this melancholy abode; for, doubtless, evidence can\neasily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.",
    "231": "\"\n\n\"That is my least concern: I am, by a course of strange events, become\nthe most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and have\nbeen, can death be any evil to me?\"\n\n\"Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the strange\nchances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some surprising\naccident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality; seized\nimmediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was presented\nto your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a\nmanner, and placed, as it were, by some fiend across your path.\"\n\nAs Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this\nretrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at the\nknowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some\nastonishment was exhibited in my countenance; for Mr. Kirwin hastened to\nsay--\n\n\"Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on your\nperson were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some\ntrace by which I could send to your relations an account of your\nmisfortune and illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one\nwhich I discovered from its commencement to be from your father. I\ninstantly wrote to Geneva: nearly two months have elapsed since the\ndeparture of my letter.--But you are ill; even now you tremble: you are\nunfit for agitation of any kind.\"\n\n\"This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event:\ntell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am\nnow to lament?\"\n\n\"Your family is perfectly well,\" said Mr. Kirwin, with gentleness; \"and\nsome one, a friend, is come to visit you.\"\n\nI know not by what chain of thought, the idea presented itself, but it\ninstantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my\nmisery, and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for\nme to comply with his hellish desires.",
    "232": " I put my hand before my eyes, and\ncried out in agony--\n\n\"Oh! take him away! I cannot see him; for God's sake, do not let him\nenter!\"\n\nMr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help\nregarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt, and said, in\nrather a severe tone--\n\n\"I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father\nwould have been welcome, instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.\"\n\n\"My father!\" cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed\nfrom anguish to pleasure: \"is my father indeed come? How kind, how very\nkind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?\"\n\nMy change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he\nthought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,\nand now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose, and\nquitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.\n\nNothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the\narrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him, and cried--\n\n\"Are you then safe--and Elizabeth--and Ernest?\"\n\nMy father calmed me with assurances of their welfare, and endeavoured,\nby dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my\ndesponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode\nof cheerfulness. \"What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!\" said\nhe, looking mournfully at the barred windows, and wretched appearance of\nthe room. \"You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to\npursue you. And poor Clerval--\"\n\nThe name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too\ngreat to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.",
    "233": "\n\n\"Alas! yes, my father,\" replied I; \"some destiny of the most horrible\nkind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I should\nhave died on the coffin of Henry.\"\n\nWe were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the\nprecarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that\ncould ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in, and insisted that my\nstrength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the\nappearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I\ngradually recovered my health.\n\nAs my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black\nmelancholy, that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was for\never before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation into\nwhich these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous\nrelapse. Alas! why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life?\nIt was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now drawing to a\nclose. Soon, oh! very soon, will death extinguish these throbbings, and\nrelieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust;\nand, in executing the award of justice, I shall also sink to rest. Then\nthe appearance of death was distant, although the wish was ever present\nto my thoughts; and I often sat for hours motionless and speechless,\nwishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer\nin its ruins.\n\nThe season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months in\nprison; and although I was still weak, and in continual danger of a\nrelapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the\ncounty-town, where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with\nevery care of collecting witnesses, and arranging my defence.",
    "234": " I was\nspared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was\nnot brought before the court that decides on life and death. The grand\njury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney\nIslands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight\nafter my removal I was liberated from prison.\n\nMy father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a\ncriminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh\natmosphere, and permitted to return to my native country. I did not\nparticipate in these feelings; for to me the walls of a dungeon or a\npalace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned for ever; and\nalthough the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I\nsaw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by\nno light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes they\nwere the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark orbs\nnearly covered by the lids, and the long black lashes that fringed them;\nsometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I first saw\nthem in my chamber at Ingolstadt.\n\nMy father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked of\nGeneva, which I should soon visit--of Elizabeth and Ernest; but these\nwords only drew deep groans from me.",
    "235": " Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish\nfor happiness; and thought, with melancholy delight, of my beloved\ncousin; or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more\nthe blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early\nchildhood: but my general state of feeling was a torpor, in which a\nprison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and\nthese fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and\ndespair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the\nexistence I loathed; and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance\nto restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.\n\nYet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally triumphed\nover my selfish despair. It was necessary that I should return without\ndelay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those I so fondly\nloved; and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any chance led me to\nthe place of his concealment, or if he dared again to blast me by his\npresence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an",
    "236": " end to the existence of\nthe monstrous Image which I had endued with the mockery of a soul still\nmore monstrous. My father still desired to delay our departure, fearful\nthat I could not sustain the fatigues of a journey: for I was a\nshattered wreck,--the shadow of a human being. My strength was gone. I\nwas a mere skeleton; and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted\nframe.\n\nStill, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and\nimpatience, my father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on\nboard a vessel bound for Havre-de-Grace, and sailed with a fair wind\nfrom the Irish shores. It was midnight. I lay on the deck, looking at\nthe stars, and listening to the dashing of the waves. I hailed the\ndarkness that shut Ireland from my sight; and my pulse beat with a\nfeverish joy when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva. The past\nappeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in\nwhich I was, the wind that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland,\nand the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly that I was\ndeceived by no vision, and that Clerval, my friend and dearest\ncompanion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I\nrepassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing\nwith my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for\nIngolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me\non to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night\nin which he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a\nthousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.\n\nEver since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of\ntaking every night a small quantity of laudanum; for it was by means of\nthis drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the\npreservation of life.",
    "237": " Oppressed by the recollection of my various\nmisfortunes, I now swallowed double my usual quantity, and soon slept\nprofoundly. But sleep did not afford me respite from thought and misery;\nmy dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I\nwas possessed by a kind of night-mare; I felt the fiend's grasp in my\nneck, and could not free myself from it; groans and cries rung in my\nears. My father, who was watching over me, perceiving my restlessness,\nawoke me; the dashing waves were around: the cloudy sky above; the fiend\nwas not here: a sense of security, a feeling that a truce was\nestablished between the present hour and the irresistible, disastrous\nfuture, imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness, of which the human\nmind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n\nThe voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon\nfound that I had overtaxed my strength, and that I must repose before I\ncould continue my journey. My father's care and attentions were\nindefatigable; but he did not know the origin of my sufferings, and\nsought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill.",
    "238": " He wished me to\nseek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not abhorred!\nthey were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt attracted even to\nthe most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic nature and\ncelestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right to share their\nintercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them, whose joy it was to\nshed their blood, and to revel in their groans. How they would, each and\nall, abhor me, and hunt me from the world, did they know my unhallowed\nacts, and the crimes which had their source in me!\n\nMy father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society, and strove by\nvarious arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I felt\ndeeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder,\nand he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.\n\n\"Alas! my father,\" said I, \"how little do you know me. Human beings,\ntheir feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such a wretch\nas I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I,\nand she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause of\nthis--I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry--they all died by my\nhands.\"\n\nMy father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same\nassertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an\nexplanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring\nof delirium, and that, during my il",
    "239": "lness, some idea of this kind had\npresented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved\nin my convalescence. I avoided explanation, and maintained a continual\nsilence concerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I\nshould be supposed mad; and this in itself would for ever have chained\nmy tongue. But, besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret\nwhich would fill my hearer with consternation, and make fear and\nunnatural horror the inmates of his breast. I checked, therefore, my\nimpatient thirst for sympathy, and was silent when I would have given\nthe world to have confided the fatal secret. Yet still words like those\nI have recorded, would burst uncontrollably from me. I could offer no\nexplanation of them; but their truth in part relieved the burden of my\nmysterious woe.\n\nUpon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded\nwonder, \"My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I\nentreat you never to make such an assertion again.\"\n\n\"I am not mad,\" I cried energetically; \"the sun and the heavens, who\nhave viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the\nassassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations. A\nthousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have\nsaved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not\nsacrifice the whole human race.\"\n\nThe conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were\nderanged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation, and\nendeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts.",
    "240": " He wished as much as\npossible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in\nIreland, and never alluded to them, or suffered me to speak of my\nmisfortunes.\n\nAs time passed away I became more calm: misery had her dwelling in my\nheart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own\ncrimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost\nself-violence, I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which\nsometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world; and my manners\nwere calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey\nto the sea of ice.\n\nA few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received\nthe following letter from Elizabeth:--\n\n\"My dear Friend,\n\n\"It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle\ndated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may\nhope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you\nmust have suffered! I expect to see you looking even more ill than when\nyou quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably, tortured\nas I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your\ncountenance, and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort\nand tranquillity.\n\n\"Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable\na year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you at\nthis period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you; but a conversation\nthat I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some\nexplanation necessary before we meet.\n\n\"Explanation! you may possibly say; what can Elizabeth have to explain?\nIf you really say this, my questions are answered, and all my doubts\nsatisfied.",
    "241": " But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may\ndread, and yet be pleased with this explanation; and, in a probability\nof this being the case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what,\nduring your absence, I have often wished to express to you, but have\nnever had the courage to begin.\n\n\"You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of\nyour parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, and\ntaught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take\nplace. We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I\nbelieve, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. But as\nbrother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each\nother, without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our\ncase? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you, by our mutual\nhappiness, with simple truth--Do you not love another?\n\n\"You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at\nIngolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last\nautumn so unhappy, flying to solitude, from the society of every\ncreature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our\nconnection, and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of\nyour parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations. But\nthis is false reasoning. I confess to you, my friend, that I love you,\nand that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend\nand companion.",
    "242": " But it is your happiness I desire as well as my own, when\nI declare to you, that our marriage would render me eternally miserable,\nunless it were the dictate of your own free choice. Even now I weep to\nthink, that, borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes, you may\nstifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that love and happiness which\nwould alone restore you to yourself. I, who have so disinterested an\naffection for you, may increase your miseries tenfold, by being an\nobstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, be assured that your cousin and\nplaymate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this\nsupposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you obey me in this one\nrequest, remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to\ninterrupt my tranquillity.\n\n\"Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer to-morrow, or the\nnext day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle\nwill send me news of your health; and if I see but one smile on your\nlips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I\nshall need no other happiness.\n\n\"ELIZABETH LAVENZA.\n\n\"Geneva, May 18th, 17--.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat\nof the fiend--\"_I will be with you on your wedding night!_\" Such was my\nsentence, and on that night would the d\u00e6mon employ every art to destroy\nme, and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to\nconsole my sufferings. On that night he had determined to consummate his\ncrimes by my death. Well, be it so; a deadly struggle would then\nassuredly take place, in which if he were victorious I should be at\npeace, and his power over me be at an end. If he were vanquished, I\nshould be a free man. Alas! what freedom? such as the peasant enjoys\nwhen his family have been massacred before his eyes, his cottage burnt,\nhis lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless, penniless, and\nalone, but free.",
    "243": " Such would be my liberty, except that in my Elizabeth I\npossessed a treasure; alas! balanced by those horrors of remorse and\nguilt, which would pursue me until death.\n\nSweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and re-read her letter, and some\nsoftened feelings stole into my heart, and dared to whisper paradisiacal\ndreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the angel's\narm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make her happy.\nIf the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet, again, I\nconsidered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My destruction\nmight indeed arrive a few months sooner; but if my torturer should\nsuspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would surely\nfind other, and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed _to\nbe with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that threat as\nbinding him to peace in the mean time; for, as if to show me that he was\nnot yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately after\nthe enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my\nimmediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my\nfather's happiness, my adversary's designs against my life should not\nretard it a single hour.",
    "244": "\n\nIn this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and\naffectionate. \"I fear, my beloved girl,\" I said, \"little happiness\nremains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in\nyou. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life,\nand my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a\ndreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with\nhorror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only\nwonder that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of\nmisery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place;\nfor, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us. But\nuntil then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most\nearnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.\"\n\nIn about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth's letter, we returned to\nGeneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection; yet tears were\nin her eyes, as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw\na change in her also. She was thinner, and had lost much of that\nheavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness, and\nsoft looks of compassion, made her a more fit companion for one blasted\nand miserable as I was.\n\nThe tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought\nmadness with it; and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity\npossessed me; sometimes I was furious, and burnt with rage; sometimes\nlow and despondent. I neither spoke, nor looked at any one, but sat\nmotionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.\n\nElizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle\nvoice would soothe me when transported by passion, and inspire me with\nhuman feelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me, and for me. When\nreason returned, she would remonstrate, and endeavour to inspire me with\nresignation. Ah! it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for\nthe guilty there is no peace.",
    "245": " The agonies of remorse poison the luxury\nthere is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.\n\nSoon after my arrival, my father spoke of my immediate marriage with\nElizabeth. I remained silent.\n\n\"Have you, then, some other attachment?\"\n\n\"None on earth. I love Elizabeth, and look forward to our union with\ndelight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate\nmyself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.\"\n\n\"My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen us;\nbut let us only cling closer to what remains, and transfer our love for\nthose whom we have lost, to those who yet live. Our circle will be\nsmall, but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.\nAnd when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of\ncare will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly\ndeprived.\"\n\nSuch were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the\nthreat returned: nor can you wonder, that, omnipotent as the fiend had\nyet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as\ninvincible; and that when he had pronounced the words, \"I shall be with\nyou on your wedding-night,\" I should regard the threatened fate as\nunavoidable. But death was no evil to me, if the loss of Elizabeth were\nbalanced with it; and I therefore, with a contented and ",
    "246": "even cheerful\ncountenance, agreed with my father, that if my cousin would consent, the\nceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the\nseal to my fate.\n\nGreat God! if for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish\nintention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself\nfor ever from my native country, and wandered a friendless outcast over\nthe earth, than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if\npossessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real\nintentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I\nhastened that of a far dearer victim.\n\nAs the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice\nor a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed\nmy feelings by an appearance of hilarity, that brought smiles and joy to\nthe countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and\nnicer eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid\ncontentment, not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes\nhad impressed, that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness,\nmight soon dissipate into an airy dream, and leave no trace but deep and\neverlasting regret.",
    "247": "\n\nPreparations were made for the event; congratulatory visits were\nreceived; and all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I\ncould, in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there, and entered with\nseeming earnestness into the plans of my father, although they might\nonly serve as the decorations of my tragedy. Through my father's\nexertions, a part of the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to\nher by the Austrian government. A small possession on the shores of Como\nbelonged to her. It was agreed that, immediately after our union, we\nshould proceed to Villa Lavenza, and spend our first days of happiness\nbeside the beautiful lake near which it stood.\n\nIn the mean time I took every precaution to defend my person, in case\nthe fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger\nconstantly about me, and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice; and\nby these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the\nperiod approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be\nregarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for\nin my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty, as the day fixed\nfor its solemnisation drew nearer, and I heard it continually spoken of\nas an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.\n\nElizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to\ncalm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my\ndestiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;\nand perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had promised\nto reveal to her on the following day.",
    "248": " My father was in the mean time\noverjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in the\nmelancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.\n\nAfter the ceremony was performed, a large party assembled at my\nfather's; but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our\njourney by water, sleeping that night at Evian, and continuing our\nvoyage on the following day. The day was fair, the wind favourable, all\nsmiled on our nuptial embarkation.\n\nThose were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the\nfeeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along: the sun was hot, but we\nwere sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy, while we enjoyed the\nbeauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw\nMont Sal\u00eave, the pleasant banks of Montal\u00e8gre, and at a distance,\nsurmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy\nmountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the\nopposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the\nambition that would quit its native country, and an almost\ninsurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.\n\nI took the hand of Elizabeth: \"You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! if you\nknew what I have suffered, and what I may yet endure, you would\nendeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair, that this\none day at least permits me to enjoy.",
    "249": "\"\n\n\"Be happy, my dear Victor,\" replied Elizabeth; \"there is, I hope,\nnothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not\npainted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me not\nto depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us; but I will\nnot listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move along, and\nhow the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the\ndome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more interesting.\nLook also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters,\nwhere we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom. What a\ndivine day! how happy and serene all nature appears!\"\n\nThus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all\nreflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating; joy\nfor a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place to\ndistraction and reverie.\n\nThe sun sunk lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance, and\nobserved its path through the chasms of the higher, and the glens of the\nlower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached\nthe amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The\nspire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it, and the range\nof mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.\n\nThe wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,\nsunk at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water,\nand caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore,\nfrom which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay.",
    "250": " The\nsun sunk beneath the horizon as we landed; and as I touched the shore, I\nfelt those cares and fears revive, which soon were to clasp me, and\ncling to me for ever.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\nIt was eight o'clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the\nshore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn, and\ncontemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured\nin darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.\n\nThe wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in\nthe west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens, and was\nbeginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight\nof the vulture, and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene\nof the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves that\nwere beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.\n\nI had been calm during the day; but so soon as night obscured the shapes\nof objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious and\nwatchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my\nbosom; every sound terrified me; but I resolved that I would sell my\nlife dearly, and not shrink from the conflict until my own life, or that\nof my adversary, was extinguished.\n\nElizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful\nsilence; but there was something in my glance which communicated terror",
    "251": "\nto her, and trembling she asked, \"What is it that agitates you, my dear\nVictor? What is it you fear?\"\n\n\"Oh! peace, peace, my love,\" replied I; \"this night, and all will be\nsafe: but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.\"\n\nI passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how\nfearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and\nI earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her until I\nhad obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.\n\nShe left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages\nof the house, and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat\nto my adversary. But I discovered no trace of him, and was beginning to\nconjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the\nexecution of his menaces; when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful\nscream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I\nheard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the\nmotion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood\ntrickling in my veins, and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This\nstate lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed\ninto the room.",
    "252": "\n\nGreat God! why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the\ndestruction of the best hope, and the purest creature of earth? She was\nthere, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging\ndown, and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair.\nEvery where I turn I see the same figure--her bloodless arms and relaxed\nform flung by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this, and\nlive? Alas! life is obstinate, and clings closest where it is most\nhated. For a moment only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on\nthe ground.\n\nWhen I recovered, I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn;\ntheir countenances expressed a breathless terror: but the horror of\nothers appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that\noppressed me. I escaped from them to the room where lay the body of\nElizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She\nhad been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her; and\nnow, as she lay, her head upon her arm, and a handkerchief thrown across\nher face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep. I rushed towards\nher, and embraced her with ardour; but the deadly languor and coldness\nof the limbs told me, that what I now held in my arms had ceased to be\nthe Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.",
    "253": " The murderous mark of the\nfiend's grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from\nher lips.\n\nWhile I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look\nup. The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind\nof panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the\nchamber. The shutters had been thrown back; and, with a sensation of\nhorror not to be described, I saw at the open window a figure the most\nhideous and abhorred. A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed\nto jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my\nwife. I rushed towards the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom,\nfired; but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and, running with the\nswiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake.\n\nThe report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to the\nspot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with boats;\nnets were cast, but in vain.",
    "254": " After passing several hours, we returned\nhopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a form\nconjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to search\nthe country, parties going in different directions among the woods and\nvines.\n\nI attempted to accompany them, and proceeded a short distance from the\nhouse; but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken\nman, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my\neyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I\nwas carried back, and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had\nhappened; my eyes wandered round the room, as if to seek something that\nI had lost.\n\nAfter an interval, I arose, and, as if by instinct, crawled into the\nroom where the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping\naround--I hung over it, and joined my sad tears to theirs--all this time\nno distinct idea presented itself to my mind; but my thoughts rambled to\nvarious subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes, and their\ncause. I was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of\nWilliam, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of\nmy wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining friends\nwere safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be\nwrithing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet. This\nidea made me shudder, and recalled me to action. I started up, and\nresolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.",
    "255": "\n\nThere were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but\nthe wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it\nwas hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I\nhired men to row, and took an oar myself; for I had always experienced\nrelief from mental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing\nmisery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured, rendered\nme incapable of any exertion. I threw down the oar; and leaning my head\nupon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up,\nI saw the scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time, and which\nI had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now\nbut a shadow and a recollection. Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain\nhad ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they\nhad done a few hours before; they had then been observed by Elizabeth.\nNothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.\nThe sun might shine, or the clouds might lower: but nothing could appear\nto me as it had done the day before.",
    "256": " A fiend had snatched from me every\nhope of future happiness: no creature had ever been so miserable as I\nwas; so frightful an event is single in the history of man.\n\nBut why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last\noverwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached\ntheir _acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know\nthat, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My\nown strength is exhausted; and I must tell, in a few words, what remains\nof my hideous narration.\n\nI arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived; but the former sunk\nunder the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable\nold man! his eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and\ntheir delight--his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doated on\nwith all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life,\nhaving few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain.\nCursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs, and\ndoomed him to waste in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors\nthat were accumulated around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave\nway: he was unable to rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my\narms.",
    "257": "\n\nWhat then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and\ndarkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes, indeed,\nI dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the\nfriends of my youth; but I awoke, and found myself in a dungeon.\nMelancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception of my\nmiseries and situation, and was then released from my prison. For they\nhad called me mad; and during many months, as I understood, a solitary\ncell had been my habitation.\n\nLiberty, however, had been an useless gift to me, had I not, as I\nawakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the memory\nof past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their\ncause--the monster whom I had created, the miserable d\u00e6mon whom I had\nsent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a\nmaddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed\nthat I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal\nrevenge on his cursed head.",
    "258": "\n\nNor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to\nreflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a\nmonth after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town, and\ntold him that I had an accusation to make; that I knew the destroyer of\nmy family; and that I required him to exert his whole authority for the\napprehension of the murderer.\n\nThe magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness:--\"Be assured,\nsir,\" said he, \"no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to\ndiscover the villain.\"\n\n\"I thank you,\" replied I; \"listen, therefore, to the deposition that I\nhave to make. It is indeed a tale so strange, that I should fear you\nwould not credit it, were there not something in truth which, however\nwonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to be mistaken\nfor a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.\" My manner, as I thus\naddressed him, was impressive, but calm; I had formed in my own heart a\nresolution to pursue my destroyer to death; and this purpose quieted my\nagony, and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related my\nhistory, briefly, but with firmness and precision, marking the dates\nwith accuracy, and never deviating into invective or exclamation.\n\nThe magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I\ncontinued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes\nshudder with horror, at others a lively surprise, unmingled with\ndisbelief, was painted on his countenance.\n\nWhen I had concluded my narration, I said, \"This is the being whom I\naccuse, and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert\nyour whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and\nhope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of\nthose functions on this occasion.",
    "259": "\"\n\nThis address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own\nauditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is\ngiven to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was\ncalled upon to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his\nincredulity returned. He, however, answered mildly, \"I would willingly\nafford you every aid in your pursuit; but the creature of whom you speak\nappears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who\ncan follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice, and inhabit\ncaves and dens where no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some\nmonths have elapsed since the commission of his crimes, and no one can\nconjecture to what place he has wandered, or what region he may now\ninhabit.\"\n\n\"I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit; and if he\nhas indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois,\nand destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts: you do\nnot credit my narrative, and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the\npunishment which is his desert.\"\n\nAs I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was\nintimidated:--\"You are mistaken,\" said he, \"I will exert myself; and if\nit is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer\npunishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have\nyourself described to be his properties, that this will prove\nimpracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you\nshould make up your mind to disappointment.\"\n\n\"That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My\nrevenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I\nconfess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage is\nunspeakable, when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose\nupon society, still exists.",
    "260": " You refuse my just demand: I have but one\nresource; and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his\ndestruction.\"\n\nI trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy\nin my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness\nwhich the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan\nmagistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of\ndevotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of\nmadness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child, and\nreverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.\n\n\"Man,\" I cried, \"how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom! Cease;\nyou know not what it is you say.\"\n\nI broke from the house angry and disturbed, and retired to meditate on\nsome other mode of action.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n\nMy present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was\nswallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed\nme with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings, and allowed me\nto be calculating and calm, at periods when otherwise delirium or death\nwould have been my portion.\n\nMy first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when\nI was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became\nhateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few\njewels which had belonged to my mother, and departed.",
    "261": "\n\nAnd now my wanderings began, which are to cease but with life. I have\ntraversed a vast portion of the earth, and have endured all the\nhardships which travellers, in deserts and barbarous countries, are wont\nto meet. How I have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my\nfailing limbs upon the sandy plain, and prayed for death. But revenge\nkept me alive; I dared not die, and leave my adversary in being.\n\nWhen I quitted Geneva, my first labour was to gain some clue by which I\nmight trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled;\nand I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain what\npath I should pursue. As night approached, I found myself at the\nentrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father\nreposed. I entered it, and approached the tomb which marked their\ngraves. Every thing was silent, except the leaves of the trees, which\nwere gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark; and the\nscene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested\nobserver. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around, and to cast\na shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the mourner.\n\nThe deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to\nrage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also\nlived, and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence.",
    "262": " I knelt on\nthe grass, and kissed the earth, and with quivering lips exclaimed, \"By\nthe sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by\nthe deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night,\nand the spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the d\u00e6mon, who caused\nthis misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this\npurpose I will preserve my life: to execute this dear revenge, will I\nagain behold the sun, and tread the green herbage of earth, which\notherwise should vanish from my eyes for ever. And I call on you,\nspirits of the dead; and on you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to\naid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed and hellish monster drink\ndeep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me.\"\n\nI had begun my adjuration with solemnity, and an awe which almost\nassured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my\ndevotion; but the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my\nutterance.\n\nI was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish\nlaugh. It rung on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it,\nand I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.",
    "263": "\nSurely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy, and have\ndestroyed my miserable existence, but that my vow was heard, and that I\nwas reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away; when a well-known\nand abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an\naudible whisper--\"I am satisfied: miserable wretch! you have determined\nto live, and I am satisfied.\"\n\nI darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded; but the devil\neluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose, and shone\nfull upon his ghastly and distorted shape, as he fled with more than\nmortal speed.\n\nI pursued him; and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a\nslight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The blue\nMediterranean appeared; and, by a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter\nby night, and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I took\nmy passage in the same ship; but he escaped, I know not how.\n\nAmidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I\nhave ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by this\nhorrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who\nfeared that if I lost all trace of him, I should despair and die, left\nsome mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw the\nprint of his huge step on the white plain.",
    "264": " To you first entering on\nlife, to whom care is new, and agony unknown, how can you understand\nwhat I have felt, and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue, were the\nleast pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil,\nand carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good\nfollowed and directed my steps; and, when I most murmured, would\nsuddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.\nSometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sunk under the exhaustion, a\nrepast was prepared for me in the desert, that restored and inspirited\nme. The fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country\nate; but I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I\nhad invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless,\nand I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed\nthe few drops that revived me, and vanish.\n\nI followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the d\u00e6mon\ngenerally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the\ncountry chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom\nseen; and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my\npath. I had money with me, and gained the friendship of the villagers by\ndistributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,\nwhich, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had\nprovided me with fire and utensils for cooking.\n\nMy life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during\nsleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! often, when most\nmiserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture.",
    "265": "\nThe spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours,\nof happiness, that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage.\nDeprived of this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During\nthe day I was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night: for in\nsleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the\nbenevolent countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my\nElizabeth's voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often,\nwhen wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming\nuntil night should come, and that I should then enjoy reality in the\narms of my dearest friends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them!\nhow did I cling to their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my\nwaking hours, and persuade myself that they still lived! At such moments\nvengeance, that burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my\npath towards the destruction of the d\u00e6mon, more as a task enjoined by\nheaven, as the mechanical impulse of some power of which I was\nunconscious, than as the ardent desire of my soul.\n\nWhat his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed,\nhe left marks in writing on the barks of the trees, or cut in stone,\nthat guided me, and instigated my fury. \"My reign is not yet over,\"\n(these words were legible in one of these inscriptions;) \"you live, and\nmy power is complete. Follow me; I seek the everlasting ices of the\nnorth, where you will feel the misery of cold and frost, to which I am\nimpassive. You will find near this place, if you follow not too tardily,\na dead hare; eat, and be refreshed.",
    "266": " Come on, my enemy; we have yet to\nwrestle for our lives; but many hard and miserable hours must you endure\nuntil that period shall arrive.\"\n\nScoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee,\nmiserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my search,\nuntil he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my\nElizabeth, and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the\nreward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!\n\nAs I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened, and\nthe cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The\npeasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy\nventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from\ntheir hiding-places to seek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice,\nand no fish could be procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief\narticle of maintenance.\n\nThe triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One\ninscription that he left was in these words:--\"Prepare! your toils only\nbegin: wrap yourself in furs, and provide food; for we shall soon enter\nupon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting\nhatred.",
    "267": "\"\n\nMy courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I\nresolved not to fail in my purpose; and, calling on Heaven to support\nme, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until\nthe ocean appeared at a distance, and formed the utmost boundary of the\nhorizon. Oh! how unlike it was to the blue seas of the south! Covered\nwith ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior\nwildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the\nMediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with rapture the\nboundary of their toils. I did not weep; but I knelt down, and, with a\nfull heart, thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the\nplace where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary's gibe, to meet and\ngrapple with him.\n\nSome weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs, and thus\ntraversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the\nfiend possessed the same advantages; but I found that, as before I had\ndaily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him: so much so, that\nwhen I first saw the ocean, he was but one day's journey in advance, and\nI hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach.",
    "268": " With new\ncourage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched\nhamlet on the sea-shore. I enquired of the inhabitants concerning the\nfiend, and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said,\nhad arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols; putting\nto flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage, through fear of his\nterrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter food, and,\nplacing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove\nof trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy\nof the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea\nin a direction that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must\nspeedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice, or frozen by the\neternal frosts.\n\nOn hearing this information, I suffered a temporary access of despair.\nHe had escaped me; and I must commence a destructive and almost endless\njourney across the mountainous ices of the ocean,--amidst cold that few\nof the inhabitants could long endure, and which I, the native of a\ngenial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea\nthat the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance\nreturned, and, like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.\nAfter a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered\nround, and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.\n\nI exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the\nFrozen Ocean; and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed\nfrom land.\n\nI cannot guess how many days have passed since then; but I have endured\nmisery, which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution\nburning within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense and\nrugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard\nthe thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction.",
    "269": " But\nagain the frost came, and made the paths of the sea secure.\n\nBy the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that I\nhad passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of\nhope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of\ndespondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured\nher prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after\nthe poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the\nsummit of a sloping ice-mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,\ndied, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye\ncaught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to\ndiscover what it could be, and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I\ndistinguished a sledge, and the distorted proportions of a well-known\nform within. Oh! with what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!\nwarm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might\nnot intercept the view I had of the d\u00e6mon; but still my sight was dimmed\nby the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that oppressed\nme, I wept aloud.\n\nBut this was not the time for delay: I disencumbered the dogs of their\ndead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food; and, after an\nhour's rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly\nirksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible; nor\ndid I again lose sight of it, except at the moments when for a short\ntime some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags.",
    "270": " I indeed\nperceptibly gained on it; and when, after nearly two days' journey, I\nbeheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within\nme.\n\nBut now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were\nsuddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I\nhad ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its\nprogress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every\nmoment more ominous and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind\narose; the sea roared; and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake,\nit split, and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work\nwas soon finished: in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me\nand my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice, that\nwas continually lessening, and thus preparing for me a hideous death.\n\nIn this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died; and\nI myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress, when I\nsaw your vessel riding at anchor, and holding forth to me hopes of\nsuccour and life. I had no conception that vessels ever came so far\nnorth, and was astounded at the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my\nsledge to construct oars; and by these means was enabled, with infinite\nfatigue, to move my ice-raft in the direction of your ship. I had\ndetermined, if you were going southward, still to trust myself to the\nmercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose.",
    "271": " I hoped to induce you\nto grant me a boat with which I could pursue my enemy. But your\ndirection was northward. You took me on board when my vigour was\nexhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships\ninto a death which I still dread--for my task is unfulfilled.\n\nOh! when will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the d\u00e6mon, allow me\nthe rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do,\nswear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape; that you will seek him,\nand satisfy my vengeance in his death. And do I dare to ask of you to\nundertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?\nNo; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear; if\nthe ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he\nshall not live--swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated\nwoes, and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. He is eloquent\nand persuasive; and once his words had even power over my heart: but\ntrust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery and\nfiendlike malice. Hear him not; call on the manes of William, Justine,\nClerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and thrust\nyour sword into his heart.",

Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his\ntale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty\nthe words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes were now\nlighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow, and\nquenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his\ncountenance and tones, and related the most horrible incidents with a\ntranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a\nvolcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression\nof the wildest rage, as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.\n\nHis tale is connected, and told with an appearance of the simplest\ntruth; yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he\nshowed me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought\nto me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his\nasseverations, however earnest and connected.",
    "273": " Such a monster has then\nreally existence! I cannot doubt it; yet I am lost in surprise and\nadmiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the\nparticulars of his creature's formation: but on this point he was\nimpenetrable.\n\n\"Are you mad, my friend?\" said he; \"or whither does your senseless\ncuriosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the world a\ndemoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! learn my miseries, and do not seek to\nincrease your own.\"\n\nFrankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history: he\nasked to see them, and then himself corrected and augmented them in many\nplaces; but principally in giving the life and spirit to the\nconversations he held with his enemy. \"Since you have preserved my\nnarration,\" said he, \"I would not that a mutilated one should go down to\nposterity.\"\n\nThus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest tale\nthat ever imagination formed. My thoughts, and every feeling of my soul,\nhave been drunk up by the interest for my guest, which this tale, and\nhis own elevated and gentle manners, have created. I wish to soothe him;\nyet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every\nhope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! the only joy that he can now know\nwill be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death. Yet he\nenjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium: he believes,\nthat, when in dreams he holds converse with his friends, and derives\nfrom that communion consolation for his miseries, or excitements to his\nvengeance, that they are not the creations of his fancy, but the beings\nthemselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world.",
    "274": " This faith\ngives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as\nimposing and interesting as truth.\n\nOur conversations are not always confined to his own history and\nmisfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays unbounded\nknowledge, and a quick and piercing apprehension. His eloquence is\nforcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates a pathetic\nincident, or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love, without\ntears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the days of his\nprosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems to feel\nhis own worth, and the greatness of his fall.\n\n\"When younger,\" said he, \"I believed myself destined for some great\nenterprise. My feelings are profound; but I possessed a coolness of\njudgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of\nthe worth of my nature supported me, when others would have been\noppressed; for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those\ntalents that might be useful to my fellow-creatures. When I reflected on\nthe work I had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive\nand rational animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common\nprojectors. But this thought, which supported me in the commencement of\nmy career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust.",
    "275": " All my\nspeculations and hopes are as nothing; and, like the archangel who\naspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell. My imagination\nwas vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application were intense; by\nthe union of these qualities I conceived the idea, and executed the\ncreation of a man. Even now I cannot recollect, without passion, my\nreveries while the work was incomplete. I trod heaven in my thoughts,\nnow exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of their effects.\nFrom my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition; but\nhow am I sunk! Oh! my friend, if you had known me as I once was, you\nwould not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency rarely\nvisited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,\nnever, never again to rise.\"\n\nMust I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I\nhave sought one who would sympathise with and love me.

I would reconcile him to life, but he\nrepulses the idea.\n\n\"I thank you, Walton,\" he said, \"for your kind intentions towards so\nmiserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties, and fresh\naffections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any\nman be to me as Clerval was; or any woman another Elizabeth?

They are dead; and but one feeling in such a\nsolitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I were engaged in any\nhigh undertaking or design, fraught with extensive utility to my\nfellow-creatures, then could I live to fulfil it.

The brave fellows, whom I have\npersuaded to be my companions, look towards me for aid; but I have none\nto bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our situation, yet\nmy courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it is terrible to reflect\nthat the lives of all these men are endangered through me. If we are\nlost, my mad schemes are the cause.\n\nAnd what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of\nmy destruction, and you will anxiously await my return.

    "277": " Oh!\nmy beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations\nis, in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a\nhusband, and lovely children; you may be happy: Heaven bless you, and\nmake you so!\n\nMy unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He\nendeavours to fill me with hope; and talks as if life were a possession\nwhich he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have\nhappened to other navigators, who have attempted this sea, and, in spite\nof myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel the\npower of his eloquence: when he speaks, they no longer despair; he\nrouses their energies, and, while they hear his voice, they believe\nthese vast mountains of ice are mole-hills, which will vanish before the\nresolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of\nexpectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny\ncaused by this despair.\n\n\nSeptember 5th.\n\nA scene has just passed of such uncommon interest, that although it is\nhighly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot\nforbear recording it.",
    "278": "\n\nWe are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of\nbeing crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of my\nunfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of\ndesolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health: a feverish fire\nstill glimmers in his eyes; but he is exhausted, and, when suddenly\nroused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent\nlifelessness.\n\nI mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny. This\nmorning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend--his eyes\nhalf closed, and his limbs hanging listlessly,--I was roused by half a\ndozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They\nentered, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his\ncompanions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to\nme, to make me a requisition, which, in justice, I could not refuse. We\nwere immured in ice, and should probably never escape; but they feared\nthat if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate, and a free passage\nbe opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage, and lead them\ninto fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted this. They\ninsisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn promise, that if\nthe vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my course southward.\n\nThis speech troubled me. I had not despaired; nor had I yet conceived\nthe idea of returning, if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in\npossibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered; when\nFrankenstein, who had at",
    "279": " first been silent, and, indeed, appeared hardly\nto have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,\nand his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men,\nhe said--\n\n\"What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you then so\neasily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious\nexpedition? And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was\nsmooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers\nand terror; because, at every new incident, your fortitude was to be\ncalled forth, and your courage exhibited; because danger and death\nsurrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome. For this was it\na glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking. You were\nhereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species; your names\nadored, as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour, and\nthe benefit of mankind. And now, behold, with the first imagination of\ndanger, or, if you will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your\ncourage, you shrink away, and are content to be handed down as men who\nhad not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls,\nthey were chilly, and returned to their warm fire-sides. Why, that\nrequires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far, and\ndragged your captain to the shame of a defeat, merely to prove\nyourselves cowards. Oh! be men, or be more than men.",
    "280": " Be steady to your\npurposes, and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your\nhearts may be; it is mutable, and cannot withstand you, if you say that\nit shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace\nmarked on your brows. Return, as heroes who have fought and conquered,\nand who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.\"\n\nHe spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings\nexpressed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and\nheroism, that can you wonder that these men were moved? They looked at\none another, and were unable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire,\nand consider of what had been said: that I would not lead them farther\nnorth, if they strenuously desired the contrary; but that I hoped that,\nwith reflection, their courage would return.\n\nThey retired, and I turned towards my friend; but he was sunk in\nlanguor, and almost deprived of life.\n\nHow all this will terminate, I know not; but I had rather die than\nreturn shamefully,--my purpose unfulfilled.",
    "281": " Yet I fear such will be my\nfate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never\nwillingly continue to endure their present hardships.\n\n\nSeptember 7th.\n\nThe die is cast; I have consented to return, if we are not destroyed.\nThus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back\nignorant and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possess,\nto bear this injustice with patience.\n\n\nSeptember 12th.\n\nIt is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility\nand glory;--I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these\nbitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and, while I am wafted\ntowards England, and towards you, I will not despond.\n\nSeptember 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were\nheard at a distance, as the islands split and cracked in every\ndirection. We were in the most imminent peril; but, as we could only\nremain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate\nguest, whose illness increased in such a degree, that he was entirely\nconfined to his bed. The ice cracked behind us, and was driven with\nforce towards the north; a breeze sprung from the west, and on the 11th\nthe passage towards the south became perfectly free. When the sailors\nsaw this, and that their return to their native country was apparently\nassured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them, loud and\nlong-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke, and asked the cause\nof the tumult. \"They shout,\" I said, \"because they will soon return to\nEngland.\"\n\n\"Do you then really return?\"\n\n\"Alas! yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them\nunwillingly to danger, and I must return.\"\n\n\"Do so, if you will; but I will not.",
    "282": " You may give up your purpose, but\nmine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not. I am weak; but surely\nthe spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient\nstrength.\" Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the bed, but the\nexertion was too great for him; he fell back, and fainted.\n\nIt was long before he was restored; and I often thought that life was\nentirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with\ndifficulty, and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing\ndraught, and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the mean time he\ntold me, that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.\n\nHis sentence was pronounced; and I could only grieve, and be patient. I\nsat by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he\nslept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and, bidding me\ncome near, said--\"Alas! the strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I\nshall soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being.\nThink not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that\nburning hatred, and ardent desire of revenge, I once expressed; but I\nfeel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary.",
    "283": " During\nthese last days I have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor\ndo I find it blamable. In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a\nrational creature, and was bound towards him, to assure, as far as was\nin my power, his happiness and well-being. This was my duty; but there\nwas another still paramount to that. My duties towards the beings of my\nown species had greater claims to my attention, because they included a\ngreater proportion of happiness or misery. Urged by this view, I\nrefused, and I did right in refusing, to create a companion for the\nfirst creature. He showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness, in\nevil: he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who\npossessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know\nwhere this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself, that he may\nrender no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction\nwas mine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious\nmotives, I asked you to undertake my unfinished work; and I renew this\nrequest now, when I am only induced by reason and virtue.\n\n\"Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends, to fulfil\nthis task; and now, that you are returning to England, you will have\nlittle chance of meeting with him.",
    "284": " But the consideration of these\npoints, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I\nleave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near\napproach of death.

The forms of the\nbeloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell,\nWalton! Seek happiness in tranquillity, and avoid ambition, even if it\nbe only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in\nscience and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been\nblasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.\"\n\nHis voice became fainter as he spoke; and at length, exhausted by his\neffort, he sunk into silence. About half an hour afterwards he attempted\nagain to speak, but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and his eyes\nclosed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away\nfrom his lips.\n\nMargaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this\nglorious spirit? What can I say, that will enable you to understand the\ndepth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and\nfeeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of\ndisappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find\nconsolation.\n\nI am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the\nbreeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir.",
    "285": " Again; there\nis a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin\nwhere the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise, and examine.\nGood night, my sister.\n\nGreat God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the\nremembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to\ndetail it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete\nwithout this final and wonderful catastrophe.\n\nI entered the cabin, where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable\nfriend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to describe;\ngigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions. As he\nhung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long locks of ragged\nhair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and apparent texture\nlike that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased\nto utter exclamations of grief and horror, and sprung towards the\nwindow. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such\nloathsome, yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily, and\nendeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this\ndestroyer. I called on him to stay.\n\nHe paused, looking on me with wonder; and, again turning towards the\nlifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every\nfeature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some\nuncontrollable passion.\n\n\"That is also my victim!\" he exclaimed: \"in his murder my crimes are\nconsummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close! Oh,\nFrankenstein! generous and self-devoted being! what does it avail that\nI now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by\ndestroying all thou lovedst. Alas! he is cold, he cannot answer me.\"\n\nHis voice seemed suffocated; and my first impulses, which had suggested\nto me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend, in destroying\nhis enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion.",
    "286": "\nI approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to\nhis face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness.\nI attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster\ncontinued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I\ngathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his\npassion: \"Your repentance,\" I said, \"is now superfluous. If you had\nlistened to the voice of conscience, and heeded the stings of remorse,\nbefore you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity,\nFrankenstein would yet have lived.\n\n\"And do you dream?\" said the d\u00e6mon; \"do you think that I was then dead\nto agony and remorse?--He,\" he continued, pointing to the corpse, \"he\nsuffered not in the consummation of the deed--oh! not the ten-thousandth\nportion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its\nexecution. A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart was\npoisoned with remorse. Think you that the groans of Clerval were music\nto my ears? My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and\nsympathy; and, when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred, it did not\nendure the violence of the change, without torture such as you cannot\neven imagine.",
    "287": "\n\n\"After the murder of Clerval, I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken\nand overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror: I\nabhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my\nexistence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness;\nthat while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me, he sought\nhis own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which\nI was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled\nme with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I recollected my threat,\nand resolved that it should be accomplished. I knew that I was preparing\nfor myself a deadly torture; but I was the slave, not the master, of an\nimpulse, which I detested, yet could not disobey. Yet when she\ndied!--nay, then I was not miserable. I had cast off all feeling,\nsubdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my despair. Evil\nthenceforth became my good.

    "292": "\n\nHORACE WALPOLE was the youngest son of Sir Robert Walpole, the great\nstatesman, who died Earl of Orford. He was born in 1717, the year in\nwhich his father resigned office, remaining in opposition for almost\nthree years before his return to a long tenure of power. Horace Walpole\nwas educated at Eton, where he formed a school friendship with Thomas\nGray, who was but a few months older. In 1739 Gray was\ntravelling-companion with Walpole in France and Italy until they differed\nand parted; but the friendship was afterwards renewed, and remained firm\nto the end. Horace Walpole went from Eton to King\u2019s College, Cambridge,\nand entered Parliament in 1741, the year before his father\u2019s final\nresignation and acceptance of an earldom. His way of life was made easy\nto him. As Usher of the Exchequer, Comptroller of the Pipe, and Clerk of\nthe Estreats in the Exchequer, he received nearly two thousand a year for\ndoing nothing, lived with his father, and amused himself.\n\nHorace Walpole idled, and amused himself with the small life of the\nfashionable world to which he was proud of belonging, though he had a\nquick eye for its vanities. He had social wit, and liked to put it to\nsmall uses. But he was not an empty idler, and there were seasons when\nhe could become a sharp judge of himself. \u201cI am sensible,\u201d he wrote to\nhis most intimate friend, \u201cI am sensible of having more follies and\nweaknesses and fewer real good qualities than most men. I sometimes\nreflect on this, though, I own, too seldom. I always want to begin\nacting like a man, and a sensible one, which I think I might be if I\nwould.\u201d He had deep home affections, and, under many polite\naffectations, plenty of good sense.\n\nHorace Walpole\u2019s father died in 1745.",
    "293": " The eldest son, who succeeded to\nthe earldom, died in 1751, and left a son, George, who was for a time\ninsane, and lived until 1791. As George left no child, the title and\nestates passed to Horace Walpole, then seventy-four years old, and the\nonly uncle who survived. Horace Walpole thus became Earl of Orford,\nduring the last six years of his life. As to the title, he said that he\nfelt himself being called names in his old age. He died unmarried, in\nthe year 1797, at the age of eighty.\n\nHe had turned his house at Strawberry Hill, by the Thames, near\nTwickenham, into a Gothic villa\u2014eighteenth-century Gothic\u2014and amused\nhimself by spending freely upon its adornment with such things as were\nthen fashionable as objects of taste. But he delighted also in his\nflowers and his trellises of roses, and the quiet Thames. When confined\nby gout to his London house in Arlington Street, flowers from Strawberry\nHill and a bird were necessary consolations. He set up also at\nStrawberry Hill a private printing press, at which he printed his friend\nGray\u2019s poems, also in 1758 his own \u201cCatalogue of the Royal and Noble\nAuthors of England,\u201d and five volumes of \u201cAnecdotes of Painting in\nEngland,\u201d between 1762 and 1771.\n\nHorace Walpole produced _The Castle of Otranto_ in 1765, at the mature\nage of forty-eight. It was suggested by a dream from which he said he\nwaked one morning, and of which \u201call I could recover was, that I had\nthought myself in an ancient castle (a very natural dream for a head like\nmine, filled with Gothic story), and that on the uppermost banister of a\ngreat staircase I saw a gigantic hand in armour.",
    "294": " In the evening I sat\ndown and began to write, without knowing in the least what I intended to\nsay or relate.\u201d So began the tale which professed to be translated by\n\u201cWilliam Marshal, gentleman, from the Italian of Onuphro Muralto, canon\nof the Church of St. Nicholas, at Otranto.\u201d It was written in two\nmonths. Walpole\u2019s friend Gray reported to him that at Cambridge the book\nmade \u201csome of them cry a little, and all in general afraid to go to bed\no\u2019 nights.\u201d _The Castle of Otranto_ was, in its own way, an early sign\nof the reaction towards romance in the latter part of the last century.\nThis gives it interest. But it has had many followers, and the hardy\nmodern reader, when he reads Gray\u2019s note from Cambridge, needs to be\nreminded of its date.\n\n H. M.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.\n\n\nThe following work was found in the library of an ancient Catholic family\nin the north of England. It was printed at Naples, in the black letter,\nin the year 1529. How much sooner it was written does not appear. The\nprincipal incidents are such as were believed in the darkest ages of\nChristianity; but the language and conduct have nothing that savours of\nbarbarism. The style is the purest Italian.\n\nIf the story was written near the time when it is supposed to have\nhappened, it must have been between 1095, the era of the first Crusade,\nand 1243, the date of the last, or not long afterwards. There is no\nother circumstance in the work that can lead us to guess at the period in\nwhich the scene is laid: the names of the actors are evidently\nfictitious, and probably disguised on purpose: yet the Spanish names of\nthe domestics seem to indicate that this work was not composed until the\nestablishment of the Arragonian Kings in Naples had made Spanish\nappellations familiar in that country.",
    "295": " The beauty of the diction, and\nthe zeal of the author (moderated, however, by singular judgment) concur\nto make me think that the date of the composition was little antecedent\nto that of the impression. Letters were then in their most flourishing\nstate in Italy, and contributed to dispel the empire of superstition, at\nthat time so forcibly attacked by the reformers. It is not unlikely that\nan artful priest might endeavour to turn their own arms on the\ninnovators, and might avail himself of his abilities as an author to\nconfirm the populace in their ancient errors and superstitions. If this\nwas his view, he has certainly acted with signal address. Such a work as\nthe following would enslave a hundred vulgar minds beyond half the books\nof controversy that have been written from the days of Luther to the\npresent hour.\n\nThis solution of the author\u2019s motives is, however, offered as a mere\nconjecture. Whatever his views were, or whatever effects the execution\nof them might have, his work can only be laid before the public at\npresent as a matter of entertainment.",
    "296": " Even as such, some apology for it\nis necessary. Miracles, visions, necromancy, dreams, and other\npreternatural events, are exploded now even from romances. That was not\nthe case when our author wrote; much less when the story itself is\nsupposed to have happened. Belief in every kind of prodigy was so\nestablished in those dark ages, that an author would not be faithful to\nthe manners of the times, who should omit all mention of them. He is not\nbound to believe them himself, but he must represent his actors as\nbelieving them.\n\nIf this air of the miraculous is excused, the reader will find nothing\nelse unworthy of his perusal. Allow the possibility of the facts, and\nall the actors comport themselves as persons would do in their situation.\nThere is no bombast, no similes, flowers, digressions, or unnecessary\ndescriptions. Everything tends directly to the catastrophe. Never is\nthe reader\u2019s attention relaxed. The rules of the drama are almost\nobserved throughout the conduct of the piece. The characters are well\ndrawn, and still better maintained. Terror, the author\u2019s principal\nengine, prevents the story from ever languishing; and it is so often\ncontrasted by pity, that the mind is kept up in a constant vicissitude of\ninteresting passions.",
    "297": "\n\nSome persons may perhaps think the characters of the domestics too little\nserious for the general cast of the story; but besides their opposition\nto the principal personages, the art of the author is very observable in\nhis conduct of the subalterns. They discover many passages essential to\nthe story, which could not be well brought to light but by their\n_na\u00efvet\u00e9_ and simplicity. In particular, the womanish terror and foibles\nof Bianca, in the last chapter, conduce essentially towards advancing the\ncatastrophe.\n\nIt is natural for a translator to be prejudiced in favour of his adopted\nwork. More impartial readers may not be so much struck with the beauties\nof this piece as I was. Yet I am not blind to my author\u2019s defects. I\ncould wish he had grounded his plan on a more useful moral than this:\nthat \u201cthe sins of fathers are visited on their children to the third and\nfourth generation.\u201d I doubt whether, in his time, any more than at\npresent, ambition curbed its appetite of dominion from the dread of so\nremote a punishment. And yet this moral is weakened by that less direct\ninsinuation, that even such anathema may be diverted by devotion to St.\nNicholas. Here the interest of the Monk plainly gets the better of the\njudgment of the author. However, with all its faults, I have no doubt\nbut the English reader will be pleased with a sight of this performance.",
    "298": "\nThe piety that reigns throughout, the lessons of virtue that are\ninculcated, and the rigid purity of the sentiments, exempt this work from\nthe censure to which romances are but too liable. Should it meet with\nthe success I hope for, I may be encouraged to reprint the original\nItalian, though it will tend to depreciate my own labour. Our language\nfalls far short of the charms of the Italian, both for variety and\nharmony. The latter is peculiarly excellent for simple narrative. It is\ndifficult in English to relate without falling too low or rising too\nhigh; a fault obviously occasioned by the little care taken to speak pure\nlanguage in common conversation. Every Italian or Frenchman of any rank\npiques himself on speaking his own tongue correctly and with choice. I\ncannot flatter myself with having done justice to my author in this\nrespect: his style is as elegant as his conduct of the passions is\nmasterly. It is a pity that he did not apply his talents to what they\nwere evidently proper for\u2014the theatre.\n\nI will detain the reader no longer, but to make one short remark. Though\nthe machinery is invention, and the names of the actors imaginary, I\ncannot but believe that the groundwork of the story is founded on truth.\nThe scene is undoubtedly laid in some real castle. The author seems\nfrequently, without design, to describe particular parts.",

If a catastrophe, at all resembling that which he\ndescribes, is believed to have given rise to this work, it will\ncontribute to interest the reader, and will make the \u201cCastle of Otranto\u201d\na still more moving story.\n\n\n\n\nSONNET TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LADY MARY COKE.\n\n\n The gentle maid, whose hapless tale\n   These melancholy pages speak;\n Say, gracious lady, shall she fail\n   To draw the tear adown thy cheek?\n\n No; never was thy pitying breast\n   Insensible to human woes;\n Tender, tho\u2019 firm, it melts distrest\n   For weaknesses it never knows.\n\n Oh! guard the marvels I relate\n Of fell ambition scourg\u2019d by fate,\n   From reason\u2019s peevish blame.\n Blest with thy smile, my dauntless sail\n I dare expand to Fancy\u2019s gale,\n   For sure thy smiles are Fame.\n\n H. W.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nManfred, Prince of Otranto, had one son and one daughter: the latter, a\nmost beautiful virgin, aged eighteen, was called Matilda. Conrad, the\nson, was three years younger, a homely youth, sickly, and of no promising\ndisposition; yet he was the darling of his father, who never showed any\nsymptoms of affection to Matilda. Manfred had contracted a marriage for\nhis son with the Marquis of Vicenza\u2019s daughter, Isabella; and she had\nalready been delivered by her guardians into the hands of Manfred, that\nhe might celebrate the wedding as soon as Conrad\u2019s infirm state of health\nwould permit.",
    "300": "\n\nManfred\u2019s impatience for this ceremonial was remarked by his family and\nneighbours. The former, indeed, apprehending the severity of their\nPrince\u2019s disposition, did not dare to utter their surmises on this\nprecipitation. Hippolita, his wife, an amiable lady, did sometimes\nventure to represent the danger of marrying their only son so early,\nconsidering his great youth, and greater infirmities; but she never\nreceived any other answer than reflections on her own sterility, who had\ngiven him but one heir. His tenants and subjects were less cautious in\ntheir discourses. They attributed this hasty wedding to the Prince\u2019s\ndread of seeing accomplished an ancient prophecy, which was said to have\npronounced that the castle and lordship of Otranto \u201cshould pass from the\npresent family, whenever the real owner should be grown too large to\ninhabit it.\u201d It was difficult to make any sense of this prophecy; and\nstill less easy to conceive what it had to do with the marriage in\nquestion. Yet these mysteries, or contradictions, did not make the\npopulace adhere the less to their opinion.\n\nYoung Conrad\u2019s birthday was fixed for his espousals. The company was\nassembled in the chapel of the Castle, and everything ready for beginning\nthe divine office, when Conrad himself was missing. Manfred, impatient\nof the least delay, and who had not observed his son retire, despatched\none of his attendants to summon the young Prince. The servant, who had\nnot stayed long enough to have crossed the court to Conrad\u2019s apartment,\ncame running back breathless, in a frantic manner, his eyes staring, and\nfoaming at the mouth.",
    "301": " He said nothing, but pointed to the court.\n\nThe company were struck with terror and amazement. The Princess\nHippolita, without knowing what was the matter, but anxious for her son,\nswooned away. Manfred, less apprehensive than enraged at the\nprocrastination of the nuptials, and at the folly of his domestic, asked\nimperiously what was the matter? The fellow made no answer, but\ncontinued pointing towards the courtyard; and at last, after repeated\nquestions put to him, cried out, \u201cOh! the helmet! the helmet!\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, some of the company had run into the court, from whence\nwas heard a confused noise of shrieks, horror, and surprise. Manfred,\nwho began to be alarmed at not seeing his son, went himself to get\ninformation of what occasioned this strange confusion. Matilda remained\nendeavouring to assist her mother, and Isabella stayed for the same\npurpose, and to avoid showing any impatience for the bridegroom, for\nwhom, in truth, she had conceived little affection.\n\nThe first thing that struck Manfred\u2019s eyes was a group of his servants\nendeavouring to raise something that appeared to him a mountain of sable\nplumes. He gazed without believing his sight.\n\n\u201cWhat are ye doing?\u201d cried Manfred, wrathfully; \u201cwhere is my son?\u201d\n\nA volley of voices replied, \u201cOh! my Lord! the Prince! the Prince! the\nhelmet! the helmet!\u201d\n\nShocked with these lamentable sounds, and dreading he knew not what, he\nadvanced hastily,\u2014but what a sight for a father\u2019s eyes!\u2014he beheld his\nchild dashed to pieces, and almost buried under an enormous helmet, an\nhundred ti",
    "302": "mes more large than any casque ever made for human being, and\nshaded with a proportionable quantity of black feathers.\n\nThe horror of the spectacle, the ignorance of all around how this\nmisfortune had happened, and above all, the tremendous phenomenon before\nhim, took away the Prince\u2019s speech. Yet his silence lasted longer than\neven grief could occasion. He fixed his eyes on what he wished in vain\nto believe a vision; and seemed less attentive to his loss, than buried\nin meditation on the stupendous object that had occasioned it. He\ntouched, he examined the fatal casque; nor could even the bleeding\nmangled remains of the young Prince divert the eyes of Manfred from the\nportent before him.\n\nAll who had known his partial fondness for young Conrad, were as much\nsurprised at their Prince\u2019s insensibility, as thunderstruck themselves at\nthe miracle of the helmet. They conveyed the disfigured corpse into the\nhall, without receiving the least direction from Manfred. As little was\nhe attentive to the ladies who remained in the chapel. On the contrary,\nwithout mentioning the unhappy princesses, his wife and daughter, the\nfirst sounds that dropped from Manfred\u2019s lips were, \u201cTake care of the\nLady Isabella.",
    "303": "\u201d\n\nThe domestics, without observing the singularity of this direction, were\nguided by their affection to their mistress, to consider it as peculiarly\naddressed to her situation, and flew to her assistance. They conveyed\nher to her chamber more dead than alive, and indifferent to all the\nstrange circumstances she heard, except the death of her son.\n\nMatilda, who doted on her mother, smothered her own grief and amazement,\nand thought of nothing but assisting and comforting her afflicted parent.\nIsabella, who had been treated by Hippolita like a daughter, and who\nreturned that tenderness with equal duty and affection, was scarce less\nassiduous about the Princess; at the same time endeavouring to partake\nand lessen the weight of sorrow which she saw Matilda strove to suppress,\nfor whom she had conceived the warmest sympathy of friendship. Yet her\nown situation could not help finding its place in her thoughts.",
    "304": " She felt\nno concern for the death of young Conrad, except commiseration; and she\nwas not sorry to be delivered from a marriage which had promised her\nlittle felicity, either from her destined bridegroom, or from the severe\ntemper of Manfred, who, though he had distinguished her by great\nindulgence, had imprinted her mind with terror, from his causeless rigour\nto such amiable princesses as Hippolita and Matilda.\n\nWhile the ladies were conveying the wretched mother to her bed, Manfred\nremained in the court, gazing on the ominous casque, and regardless of\nthe crowd which the strangeness of the event had now assembled around\nhim. The few words he articulated, tended solely to inquiries, whether\nany man knew from whence it could have come? Nobody could give him the\nleast information. However, as it seemed to be the sole object of his\ncuriosity, it soon became so to the rest of the spectators, whose\nconjectures were as absurd and improbable, as the catastrophe itself was\nunprecedented. In the midst of their senseless guesses, a young peasant,\nwhom rumour had drawn thither from a neighbouring village, observed that\nthe miraculous",
    "305": " helmet was exactly like that on the figure in black marble\nof Alfonso the Good, one of their former princes, in the church of St.\nNicholas.\n\n\u201cVillain! What sayest thou?\u201d cried Manfred, starting from his trance in\na tempest of rage, and seizing the young man by the collar; \u201chow darest\nthou utter such treason? Thy life shall pay for it.\u201d\n\nThe spectators, who as little comprehended the cause of the Prince\u2019s fury\nas all the rest they had seen, were at a loss to unravel this new\ncircumstance. The young peasant himself was still more astonished, not\nconceiving how he had offended the Prince. Yet recollecting himself,\nwith a mixture of grace and humility, he disengaged himself from\nManfred\u2019s grip, and then with an obeisance, which discovered more\njealousy of innocence than dismay, he asked, with respect, of what he was\nguilty? Manfred, more enraged at the vigour, however decently exerted,\nwith which the young man had shaken off his hold, than appeased by his\nsubmission, ordered his attendants to seize him, and, if he had not been\nwithheld by his friends whom he had invited to the nuptials, would have\npoignarded the peasant in their arms.\n\nDuring this altercation, some of the vulgar spectators had run to the\ngreat church, which stood near the castle, and came back open-mouthed,\ndeclaring that the helmet was missing from Alfonso\u2019s statue.",
    "306": " Manfred, at\nthis news, grew perfectly frantic; and, as if he sought a subject on\nwhich to vent the tempest within him, he rushed again on the young\npeasant, crying\u2014\n\n\u201cVillain! Monster! Sorcerer! \u2019tis thou hast done this! \u2019tis thou hast\nslain my son!\u201d\n\nThe mob, who wanted some object within the scope of their capacities, on\nwhom they might discharge their bewildered reasoning, caught the words\nfrom the mouth of their lord, and re-echoed\u2014\n\n\u201cAy, ay; \u2019tis he, \u2019tis he: he has stolen the helmet from good Alfonso\u2019s\ntomb, and dashed out the brains of our young Prince with it,\u201d never\nreflecting how enormous the disproportion was between the marble helmet\nthat had been in the church, and that of steel before their eyes; nor how\nimpossible it was for a youth seemingly not twenty, to wield a piece of\narmour of so prodigious a weight.\n\nThe folly of these ejaculations brought Manfred to himself: yet whether\nprovoked at the peasant having observed the resemblance between the two\nhelmets, and thereby led to the farther discovery of the absence of that\nin the church, or wishing to bury any such rumour under so impertinent a\nsupposition, he gravely pronounced that the young man was certainly a\nnecromancer, and that till the Church could take cognisance of the\naffair, he would have the Magician, ",
    "307": "whom they had thus detected, kept\nprisoner under the helmet itself, which he ordered his attendants to\nraise, and place the young man under it; declaring he should be kept\nthere without food, with which his own infernal art might furnish him.\n\nIt was in vain for the youth to represent against this preposterous\nsentence: in vain did Manfred\u2019s friends endeavour to divert him from this\nsavage and ill-grounded resolution. The generality were charmed with\ntheir lord\u2019s decision, which, to their apprehensions, carried great\nappearance of justice, as the Magician was to be punished by the very\ninstrument with which he had offended: nor were they struck with the\nleast compunction at the probability of the youth being starved, for they\nfirmly believed that, by his diabolic skill, he could easily supply\nhimself with nutriment.\n\nManfred thus saw his commands even cheerfully obeyed; and appointing a\nguard with strict orders to prevent any food being conveyed to the\nprisoner, he dismissed his friends and attendants, and retired to his own\nchamber, after locking the gates of the castle, in which he suffered none\nbut his domestics to remain.\n\nIn the meantime, the care and zeal of the young Ladies had brought the\nPrincess Hippolita to herself, who amidst",
    "308": " the transports of her own\nsorrow frequently demanded news of her lord, would have dismissed her\nattendants to watch over him, and at last enjoined Matilda to leave her,\nand visit and comfort her father. Matilda, who wanted no affectionate\nduty to Manfred, though she trembled at his austerity, obeyed the orders\nof Hippolita, whom she tenderly recommended to Isabella; and inquiring of\nthe domestics for her father, was informed that he was retired to his\nchamber, and had commanded that nobody should have admittance to him.\nConcluding that he was immersed in sorrow for the death of her brother,\nand fearing to renew his tears by the sight of his sole remaining child,\nshe hesitated whether she should break in upon his affliction; yet\nsolicitude for him, backed by the commands of her mother, encouraged her\nto venture disobeying the orders he had given; a fault she had never been\nguilty of before.\n\nThe gentle timidity of her nature made her pause for some minutes at his\ndoor. She heard him traverse his chamber backwards, and forwards with\ndisordered steps; a mood which increased her apprehensions.",
    "309": " She was,\nhowever, just going to beg admittance, when Manfred suddenly opened the\ndoor; and as it was now twilight, concurring with the disorder of his\nmind, he did not distinguish the person, but asked angrily, who it was?\nMatilda replied, trembling\u2014\n\n\u201cMy dearest father, it is I, your daughter.\u201d\n\nManfred, stepping back hastily, cried, \u201cBegone! I do not want a\ndaughter;\u201d and flinging back abruptly, clapped the door against the\nterrified Matilda.\n\nShe was too well acquainted with her father\u2019s impetuosity to venture a\nsecond intrusion. When she had a little recovered the shock of so bitter\na reception, she wiped away her tears to prevent the additional stab that\nthe knowledge of it would give to Hippolita, who questioned her in the\nmost anxious terms on the health of Manfred, and how he bore his loss.\nMatilda assured her he was well, and supported his misfortune with manly\nfortitude.\n\n\u201cBut will he not let me see him?\u201d said Hippolita mournfully; \u201cwill he not\npermit me to blend my tears with his, and shed a mother\u2019s sorrows in the\nbosom of her Lord? Or do you deceive me, Matilda? I know how Manfred\ndoted on his son: is not the stroke too heavy for him? has he not sunk\nunder it? You do not answer me\u2014alas! I dread the worst!\u2014Raise me, my\nmaidens; I will, I will see my Lord. Bear me to him instantly: he is\ndearer to me even than my children.\u201d\n\nMatilda made signs to Isabella to prevent Hippolita\u2019s rising; and both\nthose lovely young women were using their gentle violence to stop and\ncalm the Princess, when a servant, on the part of Manfred, arrived and\ntold Isabella that his Lord demanded to speak with her.\n\n\u201cWith me!\u201d cried Isabella.",
    "310": "\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d said Hippolita, relieved by a message from her Lord: \u201cManfred\ncannot support the sight of his own family. He thinks you less\ndisordered than we are, and dreads the shock of my grief. Console him,\ndear Isabella, and tell him I will smother my own anguish rather than add\nto his.\u201d\n\nAs it was now evening the servant who conducted Isabella bore a torch\nbefore her. When they came to Manfred, who was walking impatiently about\nthe gallery, he started, and said hastily\u2014\n\n\u201cTake away that light, and begone.\u201d\n\nThen shutting the door impetuously, he flung himself upon a bench against\nthe wall, and bade Isabella sit by him. She obeyed trembling.\n\n\u201cI sent for you, Lady,\u201d said he\u2014and then stopped under great appearance\nof confusion.\n\n\u201cMy Lord!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I sent for you on a matter of great moment,\u201d resumed he. \u201cDry your\ntears, young Lady\u2014you have lost your bridegroom. Yes, cruel fate! and I\nhave lost the hopes of my race! But Conrad was not worthy of your\nbeauty.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow, my Lord!\u201d said Isabella; \u201csure you do not suspect me of not feeling\nthe concern I ought: my duty and affection would have always\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThink no more of him,\u201d interrupted Manfred; \u201che was a sickly, puny\nchild, and Heaven has perhaps taken him away, that I might not trust the\nhonours of my house on so frail a foundation. The line of Manfred calls\nfor numerous supports. My foolish fondness for that boy blinded the eyes\nof my prudence\u2014but it is better as it is. I hope, in a few years, to\nhave reason to rejoice at the death of Conrad.\u201d\n\nWords cannot paint the astonishment of Isabella. At first she\napprehended that grief had disordered Manfred\u2019s understanding.",
    "311": " Her next\nthought suggested that this strange discourse was designed to ensnare\nher: she feared that Manfred had perceived her indifference for his son:\nand in consequence of that idea she replied\u2014\n\n\u201cGood my Lord, do not doubt my tenderness: my heart would have\naccompanied my hand. Conrad would have engrossed all my care; and\nwherever fate shall dispose of me, I shall always cherish his memory, and\nregard your Highness and the virtuous Hippolita as my parents.\u201d\n\n\u201cCurse on Hippolita!\u201d cried Manfred. \u201cForget her from this moment, as I\ndo. In short, Lady, you have missed a husband undeserving of your\ncharms: they shall now be better disposed of. Instead of a sickly boy,\nyou shall have a husband in the prime of his age, who will know how to\nvalue your beauties, and who may expect a numerous offspring.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlas, my Lord!\u201d said Isabella, \u201cmy mind is too sadly engrossed by the\nrecent catastrophe in your family to think of another marriage. If ever\nmy father returns, and it shall be his pleasure, I shall obey, as I did\nwhen I consented to give my hand to your son: but until his return,\npermit me to remain under your hospitable roof, and employ the melancholy\nhours in assuaging yours, Hippolita\u2019s, and the fair Matilda\u2019s\naffliction.\u201d\n\n\u201cI desired you once before,\u201d said Manfred angrily, \u201cnot to name that\nwoman: from this hour she must be a stranger to you, as she must be to\nme. In short, Isabella, since I cannot give you my son, I offer you\nmyself.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeavens!\u201d cried Isabella, waking from her delusion, \u201cwhat do I hear?\nYou! my Lord! You! My father-in-law! the father of Conrad! the husband\nof the virtuous and tender Hippolita!\u201d\n\n\u201cI tell you,\u201d said Manfred imperiously, \u201cHippolita is no longer my wife;\nI divorce her from this hour. Too long has she cursed me by her\nunfruitfulness.",
    "312": " My fate depends on having sons, and this night I trust\nwill give a new date to my hopes.\u201d\n\nAt those words he seized the cold hand of Isabella, who was half dead\nwith fright and horror. She shrieked, and started from him, Manfred rose\nto pursue her, when the moon, which was now up, and gleamed in at the\nopposite casement, presented to his sight the plumes of the fatal helmet,\nwhich rose to the height of the windows, waving backwards and forwards in\na tempestuous manner, and accompanied with a hollow and rustling sound.\nIsabella, who gathered courage from her situation, and who dreaded\nnothing so much as Manfred\u2019s pursuit of his declaration, cried\u2014\n\n\u201cLook, my Lord! see, Heaven itself declares against your impious\nintentions!\u201d\n\n\u201cHeaven nor Hell shall impede my designs,\u201d said Manfred, advancing again\nto seize the Princess.\n\nAt that instant the portrait of his grandfather, which hung over the\nbench where they had been sitting, uttered a deep sigh, and heaved its\nbreast.\n\nIsabella, whose back was turned to the picture, saw not the motion, nor\nknew whence the sound came, but started, and said\u2014\n\n\u201cHark, my Lord! What sound was that?\u201d and at the same time made towards\nthe door.\n\nManfred, distracted between the flight of Isabella, who had now reached\nthe stairs, and yet unable to keep his eyes from the picture, which began\nto move, had, however, advanced some steps after her, still looking\nbackwards on the portrait, when he saw it quit its panel, and descend on\nthe floor with a grave and melancholy air.",
    "313": "\n\n\u201cDo I dream?\u201d cried Manfred, returning; \u201cor are the devils themselves in\nleague against me? Speak, infernal spectre! Or, if thou art my\ngrandsire, why dost thou too conspire against thy wretched descendant,\nwho too dearly pays for\u2014\u201d Ere he could finish the sentence, the vision\nsighed again, and made a sign to Manfred to follow him.\n\n\u201cLead on!\u201d cried Manfred; \u201cI will follow thee to the gulf of perdition.\u201d\n\nThe spectre marched sedately, but dejected, to the end of the gallery,\nand turned into a chamber on the right hand. Manfred accompanied him at\na little distance, full of anxiety and horror, but resolved. As he would\nhave entered the chamber, the door was clapped to with violence by an\ninvisible hand. The Prince, collecting courage from this delay, would\nhave forcibly burst open the door with his foot, but found that it\nresisted his utmost efforts.\n\n\u201cSince Hell will not satisfy my curiosity,\u201d said Manfred, \u201cI will use the\nhuman means in my power for preserving my race; Isabella shall not escape\nme.",
    "314": "\u201d\n\nThe lady, whose resolution had given way to terror the moment she had\nquitted Manfred, continued her flight to the bottom of the principal\nstaircase. There she stopped, not knowing whither to direct her steps,\nnor how to escape from the impetuosity of the Prince. The gates of the\ncastle, she knew, were locked, and guards placed in the court. Should\nshe, as her heart prompted her, go and prepare Hippolita for the cruel\ndestiny that awaited her, she did not doubt but Manfred would seek her\nthere, and that his violence would incite him to double the injury he\nmeditated, without leaving room for them to avoid the impetuosity of his\npassions. Delay might give him time to reflect on the horrid measures he\nhad conceived, or produce some circumstance in her favour, if she\ncould\u2014for that night, at least\u2014avoid his odious purpose. Yet where\nconceal herself? How avoid the pursuit he would infallibly make\nthroughout the castle?\n\nAs these thoughts passed rapidly through her mind, she recollected a\nsubterraneous passage which led from the vaults of the castle to the\nchurch of St. Nicholas. Could she reach the altar before she was\novertaken, she knew even Manfred\u2019s violence would not dare to profane the\nsacredness of the place; and she determined, if no other means o",

In this resolution, she\nseized a lamp that burned at the foot of the staircase, and hurried\ntowards the secret passage.\n\nThe lower part of the castle was hollowed into several intricate\ncloisters; and it was not easy for one under so much anxiety to find the\ndoor that opened into the cavern. An awful silence reigned throughout\nthose subterraneous regions, except now and then some blasts of wind that\nshook the doors she had passed, and which, grating on the rusty hinges,\nwere re-echoed through that long labyrinth of darkness. Every murmur\nstruck her with new terror; yet more she dreaded to hear the wrathful\nvoice of Manfred urging his domestics to pursue her.\n\nShe trod as softly as impatience would give her leave, yet frequently\nstopped and listened to hear if she was followed. In one of those\nmoments she thought she heard a sigh. She shuddered, and recoiled a few\npaces. In a moment she thought she heard the step of some person. Her\nblood curdled; she concluded it was Manfred. Every suggestion that\nhorror could inspire rushed into her mind.",
    "316": " She condemned her rash\nflight, which had thus exposed her to his rage in a place where her cries\nwere not likely to draw anybody to her assistance. Yet the sound seemed\nnot to come from behind. If Manfred knew where she was, he must have\nfollowed her. She was still in one of the cloisters, and the steps she\nhad heard were too distinct to proceed from the way she had come.\nCheered with this reflection, and hoping to find a friend in whoever was\nnot the Prince, she was going to advance, when a door that stood ajar, at\nsome distance to the left, was opened gently: but ere her lamp, which she\nheld up, could discover who opened it, the person retreated precipitately\non seeing the light.\n\nIsabella, whom every incident was sufficient to dismay, hesitated whether\nshe should proceed. Her dread of Manfred soon outweighed every other\nterror. The very circumstance of the person avoiding her gave her a sort\nof courage. It could only be, she thought, some domestic belonging to\nthe castle. Her gentleness had never raised her an enemy, and conscious\ninnocence made her hope that, unless sent by the Prince\u2019s order to seek\nher, his servants would rather assist than prevent her flight.\nFortifying herself with these reflections, and believing by what she\ncould observe that she was near the mouth of the subterraneous cavern,\nshe approached the door that had been opened; but a sudden gust of wind\nthat met her at the door extinguished her lamp, and left her in total\ndarkness.\n\nWords cannot paint the horror of the Princess\u2019s situation.",
    "317": " Alone in so\ndismal a place, her mind imprinted with all the terrible events of the\nday, hopeless of escaping, expecting every moment the arrival of Manfred,\nand far from tranquil on knowing she was within reach of somebody, she\nknew not whom, who for some cause seemed concealed thereabouts; all these\nthoughts crowded on her distracted mind, and she was ready to sink under\nher apprehensions. She addressed herself to every saint in heaven, and\ninwardly implored their assistance. For a considerable time she remained\nin an agony of despair.\n\nAt last, as softly as was possible, she felt for the door, and having\nfound it, entered trembling into the vault from whence she had heard the\nsigh and steps. It gave her a kind of momentary joy to perceive an\nimperfect ray of clouded moonshine gleam from the roof of the vault,\nwhich seemed to be fallen in, and from whence hung a fragment of earth or\nbuilding, she could not distinguish which, that appeared to have been\ncrushed inwards. She advanced eagerly towards this chasm, when she\ndiscerned a human form standing close against the wall.\n\nShe shrieked, believing it the ghost of her betrothed Conrad. The\nfigure, advancing, said, in a submissive voice\u2014\n\n\u201cBe not alarmed, Lady; I will not injure you.\u201d\n\nIsabella, a little encouraged by the words and tone of voice of the\nstranger, and recollecting that this must be the person who ha",

She would have flown in a transport mixed of joy and grief to his\nbosom, but he pushed her rudely off, and said\u2014\n\n\u201cWhere is Isabella?\u201d\n\n\u201cIsabella! my Lord!\u201d said the astonished Hippolita.\n\n\u201cYes, Isabella,\u201d cried Manfred imperiously; \u201cI want Isabella.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d replied Matilda, who perceived how much his behaviour had\nshocked her mother, \u201cshe has not been with us since your Highness\nsummoned her to your apartment.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me where she is,\u201d said the Prince; \u201cI do not want to know where she\nhas been.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy good Lord,\u201d says Hippolita, \u201cyour daughter tells you the truth:\nIsabella left us by your command, and has not returned since;\u2014but, my\ngood Lord, compose yourself: retire to your rest: this dismal day has\ndisordered you.

    "328": " Gracious my\nLord,\u201d continued she, \u201clet me know what has disturbed you. Has Isabella\noffended you?\u201d\n\n\u201cTrouble me not with questions,\u201d said Manfred, \u201cbut tell me where she\nis.\u201d\n\n\u201cMatilda shall call her,\u201d said the Princess. \u201cSit down, my Lord, and\nresume your wonted fortitude.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, art thou jealous of Isabella?\u201d replied he, \u201cthat you wish to be\npresent at our interview!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood heavens! my Lord,\u201d said Hippolita, \u201cwhat is it your Highness\nmeans?\u201d\n\n\u201cThou wilt know ere many minutes are passed,\u201d said the cruel Prince.\n\u201cSend your chaplain to me, and wait my pleasure here.\u201d\n\nAt these words he flung out of the room in search of Isabella, leaving\nthe amazed ladies thunderstruck with his words and frantic deportment,\nand lost in vain conjectures on what he was meditating.\n\nManfred was now returning from the vault, attended by the peasant and a\nfew of his servants whom he had obliged to accompany him. He ascended\nthe staircase without stopping till he arrived at the gallery, at the\ndoor of which he met Hippolita and her chaplain. When Diego had been\ndismissed by Manfred, he had gone directly to the Princess\u2019s apartment\nwith the alarm of what he had seen. That excellent Lady, who no more\nthan Manfred doubted of the reality of the vision, yet affected to treat\nit as a delirium of the servant. Willing, however, to save her Lord from\nany additional shock, and prepared by a series of griefs not to tremble\nat any accession to it, she determined to make herself the first\nsacrifice, if fate had marked the present hour for their destruction.",
    "329": "\nDismissing the reluctant Matilda to her rest, who in vain sued for leave\nto accompany her mother, and attended only by her chaplain, Hippolita had\nvisited the gallery and great chamber; and now with more serenity of soul\nthan she had felt for many hours, she met her Lord, and assured him that\nthe vision of the gigantic leg and foot was all a fable; and no doubt an\nimpression made by fear, and the dark and dismal hour of the night, on\nthe minds of his servants. She and the chaplain had examined the\nchamber, and found everything in the usual order.\n\nManfred, though persuaded, like his wife, that the vision had been no\nwork of fancy, recovered a little from the tempest of mind into which so\nmany strange events had thrown him. Ashamed, too, of his inhuman\ntreatment of a Princess who returned every injury with new marks of\ntenderness and duty, he felt returning love forcing itself into his eyes;\nbut not less ashamed of feeling remorse towards one against whom he was\ninwardly meditating a yet more bitter outrage, he curbed the yearnings of\nhis heart, and did not dare to lean even towards pity. The next\ntransition of his soul was to exquisite villainy.\n\nPresuming on the unshaken submission of Hippolita, he flattered himself\nthat she would not only acquiesce with patience to a divorce, but would\nobey, if it was his pleasure, in endeavouring to persuade Isabella to\ngive him her hand\u2014but ere he could indulge his horrid hope, he reflected\nthat Isabella was not to be found. Coming to himself, he gave orders\nthat every avenue to the castle should be strictly guarded, and charged\nhis domestics on pain of their lives to suffer nobody to pass out. The\nyoung peasant, to whom he spoke favourably, he ordered to remain in a\nsmall chamber on the stairs, in which there was a pallet-bed, and the key\nof which he took away himself, telling the youth he would talk with him\nin the morning.",
    "330": " Then dismissing his attendants, and bestowing a sullen\nkind of half-nod on Hippolita, he retired to his own chamber.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nMatilda, who by Hippolita\u2019s order had retired to her apartment, was\nill-disposed to take any rest. The shocking fate of her brother had\ndeeply affected her. She was surprised at not seeing Isabella; but the\nstrange words which had fallen from her father, and his obscure menace to\nthe Princess his wife, accompanied by the most furious behaviour, had\nfilled her gentle mind with terror and alarm. She waited anxiously for\nthe return of Bianca, a young damsel that attended her, whom she had sent\nto learn what was become of Isabella. Bianca soon appeared, and informed\nher mistress of what she had gathered from the servants, that Isabella\nwas nowhere to be found. She related the adventure of the young peasant\nwho had been discovered in the vault, though with many simple additions\nfrom the incoherent accounts of the domestics; and she dwelt principally\non the gigantic leg and foot which had been seen in the gallery-chamber.\nThis last circumstance had terrified Bianca so much, that she was\nrejoiced when Matilda told her that she would not go to rest, but would\nwatch till the Princess should rise.\n\nThe young Princess wearied herself in conjectures on the flight of\nIsabella, and on the threats of Manfred to her mother. \u201cBut what\nbusiness could he have so urgent with the chaplain?\u201d said Matilda, \u201cDoes\nhe intend to have my brother\u2019s body interred privately in the chapel?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Madam!\u201d said Bianca, \u201cnow I guess.",

No, Bianca; his\nheart was ever a stranger to me\u2014but he is my father, and I must not\ncomplain. Nay, if Heaven shuts my father\u2019s heart against me, it overpays\nmy little merit in the tenderness of my mother\u2014O that dear mother! yes,\nBianca, \u2019tis there I feel the rugged temper of Manfred.

I was but in jest.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the wind,\u201d said Matilda, \u201cwhistling through the battlements in the\ntower above: you have heard it a thousand times.\u201d\n\n\u201cNay,\u201d said Bianca, \u201cthere was no harm neither in what I said: it is no\nsin to talk of matrimony\u2014and so, Madam, as I was saying, if my Lord\nManfred should offer you a handsome young Prince for a bridegroom, you\nwould drop him a curtsey, and tell him you would rather take the veil?\u201d\n\n\u201cThank Heaven!

The character of that virtuous\nPrince, the veneration with which my mother has inspired me for his\nmemory, the orisons which, I know not why, she has enjoined me to pour\nforth at his tomb, all have concurred to persuade me that somehow or\nother my destiny is linked with something relating to him.",
    "333": "\u201d\n\n\u201cLord, Madam! how should that be?\u201d said Bianca; \u201cI have always heard that\nyour family was in no way related to his: and I am sure I cannot conceive\nwhy my Lady, the Princess, sends you in a cold morning or a damp evening\nto pray at his tomb: he is no saint by the almanack.

    "350": "\u201d\n\n\u201cI may believe as much or as little as I please of this,\u201d said Manfred;\n\u201cbut I will hear thy own story before I examine into the truth of it.\nTell me, what reason did the Princess give thee for making her escape?\nthy life depends on thy answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe told me,\u201d replied Theodore, \u201cthat she was on the brink of\ndestruction, and that if she could not escape from the castle, she was in\ndanger in a few moments of being made miserable for ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd on this slight foundation, on a silly girl\u2019s report,\u201d said Manfred,\n\u201cthou didst hazard my displeasure?\u201d\n\n\u201cI fear no man\u2019s displeasure,\u201d said Theodore, \u201cwhen a woman in distress\nputs herself under my protection.\u201d\n\nDuring this examination, Matilda was going to the apartment of Hippolita.\nAt the upper end of the hall, where Manfred sat, was a boarded gallery\nwith latticed windows, through which Matilda and Bianca were to pass.\nHearing her father\u2019s voice, and seeing the servants assembled round him,\nshe stopped to learn the occasion. The prisoner soon drew her attention:\nthe steady and composed manner in which he answered, and the gallantry of\nhis last reply, which were the first words she heard distinctly,\ninterested her in his favour. His person was noble, handsome, and\ncommanding, even in that situation: but his countenance soon engrossed\nher whole care.\n\n\u201cHeavens! Bianca,\u201d said the Princess softly, \u201cdo I dream? or is not that\nyouth the exact resemblance of Alfonso\u2019s picture in the gallery?\u201d\n\nShe could say no more, for her father\u2019s voice grew louder at every word.\n\n\u201cThis bravado,\u201d said he, \u201csurpasses all thy former insolence.",
    "351": " Thou shalt\nexperience the wrath with which thou darest to trifle. Seize him,\u201d\ncontinued Manfred, \u201cand bind him\u2014the first news the Princess hears of her\nchampion shall be, that he has lost his head for her sake.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe injustice of which thou art guilty towards me,\u201d said Theodore,\n\u201cconvinces me that I have done a good deed in delivering the Princess\nfrom thy tyranny. May she be happy, whatever becomes of me!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a lover!\u201d cried Manfred in a rage: \u201ca peasant within sight of\ndeath is not animated by such sentiments. Tell me, tell me, rash boy,\nwho thou art, or the rack shall force thy secret from thee.\u201d\n\n\u201cThou hast threatened me with death already,\u201d said the youth, \u201cfor the\ntruth I have told thee: if that is all the encouragement I am to expect\nfor sincerity, I am not tempted to indulge thy vain curiosity farther.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen thou wilt not speak?\u201d said Manfred.\n\n\u201cI will not,\u201d replied he.\n\n\u201cBear him away into the courtyard,\u201d said Manfred; \u201cI will see his head\nthis instant severed from his body.\u201d\n\nMatilda fainted at hearing those words. Bianca shrieked, and cried\u2014\u201cHelp! help! the Princess is dead!\u201d\n\nManfred started at this ejaculation, and demanded what was the matter!\nThe young peasant, who heard it too, was struck with horror, and asked\neagerly the same question; but Manfred ordered him to be hurried into\nthe court, and kept there for execution, till he had informed himself\nof the cause of Bianca\u2019s shrieks.",
    "352": " When he learned the meaning, he\ntreated it as a womanish panic, and ordering Matilda to be carried to\nher apartment, he rushed into the court, and calling for one of his\nguards, bade Theodore kneel down, and prepare to receive the fatal blow.\n\nThe undaunted youth received the bitter sentence with a resignation that\ntouched every heart but Manfred\u2019s. He wished earnestly to know the\nmeaning of the words he had heard relating to the Princess; but fearing\nto exasperate the tyrant more against her, he desisted. The only boon he\ndeigned to ask was, that he might be permitted to have a confessor, and\nmake his peace with heaven. Manfred, who hoped by the confessor\u2019s means\nto come at the youth\u2019s history, readily granted his request; and being\nconvinced that Father Jerome was now in his interest, he ordered him to\nbe called and shrive the prisoner. The holy man, who had little foreseen\nthe catastrophe that his imprudence occasioned, fell on his knees to the\nPrince, and adjured him in the most solemn manner not to shed innocent\nblood. He accused himself in the bitterest terms for his indiscretion,\nendeavoured to disculpate the youth, and left no method untried to soften\nthe tyrant\u2019s rage. Manfred, more incensed than appeased by Jerome\u2019s\nintercession, whose retraction now made him suspect he had been imposed\nupon by both, commanded the Friar to do his duty, telling him he would\nnot allow the prisoner many minutes for confession.\n\n\u201cNor do I ask many, my Lord,\u201d said the unhappy young man. \u201cMy sins,\nthank heaven, have not been numerous; nor exceed what might be expected\nat my years.",

I am thy murderer! it is I have brought this dismal hour\nupon thee!\u201d\n\n\u201cI forgive thee from my soul,\u201d said the youth, \u201cas I hope heaven will\npardon me.

As he stooped, his\nshirt slipped down below his shoulder, and discovered the mark of a\nbloody arrow.\n\n\u201cGracious heaven!\u201d cried the holy man, starting; \u201cwhat do I see? It is\nmy child! my Theodore!\u201d\n\nThe passions that ensued must be conceived; they cannot be painted. The\ntears of the assistants were suspended by wonder, rather than stopped by\njoy. They seemed to inquire in the eyes of their Lord what they ought to\nfeel. Surprise, doubt, tenderness, respect, succeeded each other in the\ncountenance of the youth. He received with modest submission the\neffusion of the old man\u2019s tears and embraces.

    "358": " At the\nsame instant the sable plumes on the enchanted helmet, which still\nremained at the other end of the court, were tempestuously agitated, and\nnodded thrice, as if bowed by some invisible wearer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nManfred\u2019s heart misgave him when he beheld the plumage on the miraculous\ncasque shaken in concert with the sounding of the brazen trumpet.\n\n\u201cFather!\u201d said he to Jerome, whom he now ceased to treat as Count of\nFalconara, \u201cwhat mean these portents?

I doubt whether it even notifies its will through\nFriars\u2014but that is your affair, not mine. At present you know my\npleasure; and it is not a saucy Herald that shall save your son, if you\ndo not return with the Princess.",
    "360": "\u201d\n\nIt was in vain for the holy man to reply. Manfred commanded him to be\nconducted to the postern-gate, and shut out from the castle. And he\nordered some of his attendants to carry Theodore to the top of the black\ntower, and guard him strictly; scarce permitting the father and son to\nexchange a hasty embrace at parting. He then withdrew to the hall, and\nseating himself in princely state, ordered the Herald to be admitted to\nhis presence.\n\n\u201cWell! thou insolent!\u201d said the Prince, \u201cwhat wouldst thou with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI come,\u201d replied he, \u201cto thee, Manfred, usurper of the principality of\nOtranto, from the renowned and invincible Knight, the Knight of the\nGigantic Sabre: in the name of his Lord, Frederic, Marquis of Vicenza, he\ndemands the Lady Isabella, daughter of that Prince, whom thou hast basely\nand traitorously got into thy power, by bribing her false guardians\nduring his absence; and he requires thee to resign the principality of\nOtranto, which thou hast usurped from the said Lord Frederic, the nearest\nof blood to the last rightful Lord, Alfonso the Good. If thou dost not\ninstantly comply with these just demands, he defies thee to single combat\nto the last extremity.\u201d And so saying the Herald cast down his warder.\n\n\u201cAnd where is this braggart who sends thee?\u201d said Manfred.\n\n\u201cAt the distance of a league,\u201d said the Herald: \u201che comes to make good\nhis Lord\u2019s claim against thee, as he is a true knight, and thou an\nusurper and ravisher.\u201d\n\nInjurious as this challenge was, Manfred reflected that it was not his\ninterest to provoke the Marquis. He knew how well founded the claim of\nFrederic was; nor was this the first time he had heard of it. Frederic\u2019s\nancestors had assumed the style of Princes of Otranto, from the death of\nAlfonso the Good without issue; but Man",
    "361": "fred, his father, and grandfather,\nhad been too powerful for the house of Vicenza to dispossess them.\nFrederic, a martial and amorous young Prince, had married a beautiful\nyoung lady, of whom he was enamoured, and who had died in childbed of\nIsabella. Her death affected him so much that he had taken the cross and\ngone to the Holy Land, where he was wounded in an engagement against the\ninfidels, made prisoner, and reported to be dead. When the news reached\nManfred\u2019s ears, he bribed the guardians of the Lady Isabella to deliver\nher up to him as a bride for his son Conrad, by which alliance he had\nproposed to unite the claims of the two houses. This motive, on Conrad\u2019s\ndeath, had co-operated to make him so suddenly resolve on espousing her\nhimself; and the same reflection determined him now to endeavour at\nobtaining the consent of Frederic to this marriage. A like policy\ninspired him with the thought of inviting Frederic\u2019s champion into the\ncastle, lest he should be informed of Isabella\u2019s flight, which he\nstrictly enjoined his domestics not to disclose to any of the Knight\u2019s\nretinue.\n\n\u201cHerald,\u201d said Manfred, as soon as he had digested these reflections,\n\u201creturn to thy master, and tell him, ere we liquidate our differences by\nthe sword, Manfred would hold some converse with him. Bid him welcome to\nmy castle, where by my faith, as I am a true Knight, he shall have\ncourteous reception, and full security for himself and followers. If we\ncannot adjust our quarrel by amicable means, I swear he shall depart in\nsafety, and shall have full satisfaction according to the laws of arms:\nSo help me God and His holy Trinity!\u201d\n\nThe Herald made three obeisances and retired.\n\nDuring this interview Jerome\u2019s mind was agitated by a thousand contrary\npassions. He trembled for the life of his son, and his first thought was\nto persuade Isabella to return to the castle. Yet he was scarce less\nalarmed at the thought of her union with Manfred.",
    "362": " He dreaded Hippolita\u2019s\nunbounded submission to the will of her Lord; and though he did not doubt\nbut he could alarm her piety not to consent to a divorce, if he could get\naccess to her; yet should Manfred discover that the obstruction came from\nhim, it might be equally fatal to Theodore. He was impatient to know\nwhence came the Herald, who with so little management had questioned the\ntitle of Manfred: yet he did not dare absent himself from the convent,\nlest Isabella should leave it, and her flight be imputed to him. He\nreturned disconsolately to the monastery, uncertain on what conduct to\nresolve. A Monk, who met him in the porch and observed his melancholy\nair, said\u2014\n\n\u201cAlas! brother, is it then true that we have lost our excellent Princess\nHippolita?\u201d\n\nThe holy man started, and cried, \u201cWhat meanest thou, brother? I come\nthis instant from the castle, and left her in perfect health.\u201d\n\n\u201cMartelli,\u201d replied the other Friar, \u201cpassed by the convent but a quarter\nof an hour ago on his way from the castle, and reported that her Highness\nwas dead. All our brethren are gone to the chapel to pray for her happy\ntransit to a better life, and willed me to wait thy arrival. They know\nthy holy attachment to that good Lady, and are anxious for the affliction\nit will cause in thee\u2014indeed we have all reason to weep; she was a mother\nto our house.",
    "363": " But this life is but a pilgrimage; we must not murmur\u2014we\nshall all follow her! May our end be like hers!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood brother, thou dreamest,\u201d said Jerome. \u201cI tell thee I come from the\ncastle, and left the Princess well. Where is the Lady Isabella?\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor Gentlewoman!\u201d replied the Friar; \u201cI told her the sad news, and\noffered her spiritual comfort. I reminded her of the transitory\ncondition of mortality, and advised her to take the veil: I quoted the\nexample of the holy Princess Sanchia of Arragon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThy zeal was laudable,\u201d said Jerome, impatiently; \u201cbut at present it was\nunnecessary: Hippolita is well\u2014at least I trust in the Lord she is; I\nheard nothing to the contrary\u2014yet, methinks, the Prince\u2019s\nearnestness\u2014Well, brother, but where is the Lady Isabella?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know not,\u201d said the Friar; \u201cshe wept much, and said she would retire\nto her chamber.\u201d\n\nJerome left his comrade abruptly, and hastened to the Princess, but she\nwas not in her chamber. He inquired of the domestics of the convent, but\ncould learn no news of her. He searched in vain throughout the monastery\nand the church, and despatched messengers round the neighbourhood, to get\nintelligence if she had been seen; but to no purpose. Nothing could\nequal the good man\u2019s perplexity. He judged that Isabella, suspecting\nManfred of having precipitated his wife\u2019s death, had taken the alarm, and\nwithdrawn herself to some more secret place of concealment. This new\nflight would probably carry the Prince\u2019s fury to the height.",
    "364": " The report\nof Hippolita\u2019s death, though it seemed almost incredible, increased his\nconsternation; and though Isabella\u2019s escape bespoke her aversion of\nManfred for a husband, Jerome could feel no comfort from it, while it\nendangered the life of his son. He determined to return to the castle,\nand made several of his brethren accompany him to attest his innocence to\nManfred, and, if necessary, join their intercession with his for\nTheodore.\n\nThe Prince, in the meantime, had passed into the court, and ordered the\ngates of the castle to be flung open for the reception of the stranger\nKnight and his train. In a few minutes the cavalcade arrived. First\ncame two harbingers with wands. Next a herald, followed by two pages and\ntwo trumpets. Then a hundred foot-guards. These were attended by as\nmany horse. After them fifty footmen, clothed in scarlet and black, the\ncolours of the Knight. Then a led horse. Two heralds on each side of a\ngentleman on horseback bearing a banner with the arms of Vicenza and\nOtranto quarterly\u2014a circumstance that much offended Manfred\u2014but he\nstifled his resentment. Two more pages. The Knight\u2019s confessor telling\nhis beads. Fifty more footmen clad as before. Two Knights habited in\ncomplete armour, their beavers down, comrades to the principal Knight.\nThe squires of the two Knights, carrying their shields and devices. The\nKnight\u2019s own squire. A hundred gentlemen bearing an enormous sword, and\nseeming to faint under the weight of it. The Knight himself on a\nchestnut steed, in complete armour, his lance in the rest, his face\nentirely concealed by his vizor, which was surmounted by a large plume of\nscarlet and black feathers. Fifty foot-guards with drums and trumpets\nclosed the procession, which wheeled off to the right and left to make\nroom for the principal Knight.",
    "365": "\n\nAs soon as he approached the gate he stopped; and the herald advancing,\nread again the words of the challenge. Manfred\u2019s eyes were fixed on the\ngigantic sword, and he scarce seemed to attend to the cartel: but his\nattention was soon diverted by a tempest of wind that rose behind him.\nHe turned and beheld the Plumes of the enchanted helmet agitated in the\nsame extraordinary manner as before. It required intrepidity like\nManfred\u2019s not to sink under a concurrence of circumstances that seemed to\nannounce his fate. Yet scorning in the presence of strangers to betray\nthe courage he had always manifested, he said boldly\u2014\n\n\u201cSir Knight, whoever thou art, I bid thee welcome. If thou art of mortal\nmould, thy valour shall meet its equal: and if thou art a true Knight,\nthou wilt scorn to employ sorcery to carry thy point. Be these omens\nfrom heaven or hell, Manfred trusts to the righteousness of his cause and\nto the aid of St. Nicholas, who has ever protected his house. Alight,\nSir Knight, and repose thyself.",
    "366": " To-morrow thou shalt have a fair field,\nand heaven befriend the juster side!\u201d\n\nThe Knight made no reply, but dismounting, was conducted by Manfred to\nthe great hall of the castle. As they traversed the court, the Knight\nstopped to gaze on the miraculous casque; and kneeling down, seemed to\npray inwardly for some minutes. Rising, he made a sign to the Prince to\nlead on. As soon as they entered the hall, Manfred proposed to the\nstranger to disarm, but the Knight shook his head in token of refusal.\n\n\u201cSir Knight,\u201d said Manfred, \u201cthis is not courteous, but by my good faith\nI will not cross thee, nor shalt thou have cause to complain of the\nPrince of Otranto. No treachery is designed on my part; I hope none is\nintended on thine; here take my gage\u201d (giving him his ring): \u201cyour\nfriends and you shall enjoy the laws of hospitality. Rest here until\nrefreshments are brought. I will but give orders for the accommodation\nof your train, and return to you.\u201d The three Knights bowed as accepting\nhis courtesy. Manfred directed the stranger\u2019s retinue to be conducted to\nan adjacent hospital, founded by the Princess Hippolita for the reception\nof pilgrims. As they made the circuit of the court to return towards the\ngate, the gigantic sword burst from the supporters, and falling to the\nground opposite to the helmet, remained immovable. Manfred, almost\nhardened to preternatural appearances, surmounted the shock of this new\nprodigy; and returning to the hall, where by this time the feast was\nready, he invited his silent guests to take their places. Manfred,\nhowever ill his heart was at ease, endeavoured to inspire the company\nwith mirth. He put several questions to them, but was answered only by\nsigns. They raised their vizors but sufficiently to feed themselves, and\nthat sparingly.\n\n\u201cSirs\u201d said the Prince, \u201cye are the first guests I ever treated within\nthese walls who scorned to hold any intercourse with me: nor has it oft\nbeen customary, I ween, for princes to hazard their state and dignity\nagainst strangers and mutes.",
    "367": " You say you come in the name of Frederic of\nVicenza; I have ever heard that he was a gallant and courteous Knight;\nnor would he, I am bold to say, think it beneath him to mix in social\nconverse with a Prince that is his equal, and not unknown by deeds in\narms. Still ye are silent\u2014well! be it as it may\u2014by the laws of\nhospitality and chivalry ye are masters under this roof: ye shall do your\npleasure. But come, give me a goblet of wine; ye will not refuse to\npledge me to the healths of your fair mistresses.\u201d\n\nThe principal Knight sighed and crossed himself, and was rising from the\nboard.\n\n\u201cSir Knight,\u201d said Manfred, \u201cwhat I said was but in sport. I shall\nconstrain you in nothing: use your good liking. Since mirth is not your\nmood, let us be sad. Business may hit your fancies better. Let us\nwithdraw, and hear if what I have to unfold may be better relished than\nthe vain efforts I have made for your pastime.\u201d\n\nManfred then conducting the three Knights into an inner chamber, shut the\ndoor, and inviting them to be seated, began thus, addressing himself to\nthe chief personage:\u2014\n\n\u201cYou come, Sir Knight, as I understand, in the name of the Marquis of\nVicenza, to re-demand the Lady Isabella, his daughter, who has been\ncontracted in the face of Holy Church to my son, by the consent of her\nlegal guardians; and to require m",
    "368": "e to resign my dominions to your Lord,\nwho gives himself for the nearest of blood to Prince Alfonso, whose soul\nGod rest! I shall speak to the latter article of your demands first.\nYou must know, your Lord knows, that I enjoy the principality of Otranto\nfrom my father, Don Manuel, as he received it from his father, Don\nRicardo. Alfonso, their predecessor, dying childless in the Holy Land,\nbequeathed his estates to my grandfather, Don Ricardo, in consideration\nof his faithful services.\u201d The stranger shook his head.\n\n\u201cSir Knight,\u201d said Manfred, warmly, \u201cRicardo was a valiant and upright\nman; he was a pious man; witness his munificent foundation of the\nadjoining church and two convents. He was peculiarly patronised by St.\nNicholas\u2014my grandfather was incapable\u2014I say, Sir, Don Ricardo was\nincapable\u2014excuse me, your interruption has disordered me. I venerate the\nmemory of my grandfather. Well, Sirs, he held this estate; he held it by\nhis good sword and by the favour of St. Nicholas\u2014so did my father; and\nso, Sirs, will I, come what come will. But Frederic, your Lord, is\nnearest in blood. I have consented to put my title to the issue of the\nsword. Does that imply a vicious title? I might have asked, where is\nFrederic your Lord? Report speaks him dead in captivity. You say, your\nactions say, he lives\u2014I question it not\u2014I might, Sirs, I might\u2014but I do\nnot. Other Princes would bid Frederic take his inheritance by force, if\nhe can: they would not stake their dignity on a single combat: they would\nnot submit it to the decision of unknown mutes!\u2014pardon me, gentlemen, I\nam too warm: but suppose yourselves in my situation: as ye are stout\nKnights, would it not move your choler to have your own and the honour of\nyour ancestors called in question?\u201d \u201cBut to the point.",
    "369": " Ye require me to\ndeliver up the Lady Isabella. Sirs, I must ask if ye are authorised to\nreceive her?\u201d\n\nThe Knight nodded.\n\n\u201cReceive her,\u201d continued Manfred; \u201cwell, you are authorised to receive\nher, but, gentle Knight, may I ask if you have full powers?\u201d\n\nThe Knight nodded.\n\n\u201c\u2019Tis well,\u201d said Manfred; \u201cthen hear what I have to offer. Ye see,\ngentlemen, before you, the most unhappy of men!\u201d (he began to weep);\n\u201cafford me your compassion; I am entitled to it, indeed I am. Know, I\nhave lost my only hope, my joy, the support of my house\u2014Conrad died\nyester morning.\u201d\n\nThe Knights discovered signs of surprise.\n\n\u201cYes, Sirs, fate has disposed of my son. Isabella is at liberty.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you then restore her?\u201d cried the chief Knight, breaking silence.\n\n\u201cAfford me your patience,\u201d said Manfred. \u201cI rejoice to find, by this\ntestimony of your goodwill, that this matter may be adjusted without\nblood. It is no interest of mine dictates what little I have farther to\nsay. Ye behold in me a man disgusted with the world: the loss of my son\nhas weaned me from earthly cares. Power and greatness have no longer any\ncharms in my eyes. I wished to transmit the sceptre I had received from\nmy ancestors with honour to my son\u2014but that is over! Life itself is so\nindifferent to me, that I accepted your defiance with joy. A good Knight\ncannot go to the grave with more satisfaction than when falling in his\nvocation: whatever is the will of heaven, I submit; for alas! Sirs, I am\na man of many sorrows. Manfred is no object of envy, but no doubt you\nare acquainted with my story.\u201d\n\nThe Knight made signs of ignorance, and seemed curious to have Manfred\nproceed.",
    "370": "\n\n\u201cIs it possible, Sirs,\u201d continued the Prince, \u201cthat my story should be a\nsecret to you? Have you heard nothing relating to me and the Princess\nHippolita?\u201d\n\nThey shook their heads.\n\n\u201cNo! Thus, then, Sirs, it is. You think me ambitious: ambition, alas!\nis composed of more rugged materials. If I were ambitious, I should not\nfor so many years have been a prey to all the hell of conscientious\nscruples. But I weary your patience: I will be brief. Know, then, that\nI have long been troubled in mind on my union with the Princess\nHippolita. Oh! Sirs, if ye were acquainted with that excellent woman! if\nye knew that I adore her like a mistress, and cherish her as a friend\u2014but\nman was not born for perfect happiness! She shares my scruples, and with\nher consent I have brought this matter before the church, for we are\nrelated within the forbidden degrees. I expect every hour the definitive\nsentence that must separate us for ever\u2014I am sure you feel for me\u2014I see\nyou do\u2014pardon these tears!\u201d\n\nThe Knights gazed on each other, wondering where this would end.\n\nManfred continued\u2014\n\n\u201cThe death of my son betiding while my soul was under this anxiety, I\nthought of nothing but resigning my dominions, and retiring for ever from\nthe sight of mankind. My only difficulty was to fix on a successor, who\nwould be tender of my people, and to dispose of the Lady Isabella, who is\ndear to me as my own blood.",
    "371": " I was willing to restore the line of\nAlfonso, even in his most distant kindred. And though, pardon me, I am\nsatisfied it was his will that Ricardo\u2019s lineage should take place of his\nown relations; yet where was I to search for those relations? I knew of\nnone but Frederic, your Lord; he was a captive to the infidels, or dead;\nand were he living, and at home, would he quit the flourishing State of\nVicenza for the inconsiderable principality of Otranto? If he would not,\ncould I bear the thought of seeing a hard, unfeeling, Viceroy set over my\npoor faithful people? for, Sirs, I love my people, and thank heaven am\nbeloved by them. But ye will ask whither tends this long discourse?\nBriefly, then, thus, Sirs. Heaven in your arrival seems to point out a\nremedy for these difficulties and my misfortunes. The Lady Isabella is\nat liberty; I shall soon be so. I would submit to anything for the good\nof my people. Were it not the best, the only way to extinguish the feuds\nbetween our families, if I was to take the Lady Isabella to wife? You\nstart.",
    "372": " But though Hippolita\u2019s virtues will ever be dear to me, a Prince\nmust not consider himself; he is born for his people.\u201d A servant at that\ninstant entering the chamber apprised Manfred that Jerome and several of\nhis brethren demanded immediate access to him.\n\nThe Prince, provoked at this interruption, and fearing that the Friar\nwould discover to the strangers that Isabella had taken sanctuary, was\ngoing to forbid Jerome\u2019s entrance. But recollecting that he was\ncertainly arrived to notify the Princess\u2019s return, Manfred began to\nexcuse himself to the Knights for leaving them for a few moments, but was\nprevented by the arrival of the Friars. Manfred angrily reprimanded them\nfor their intrusion, and would have forced them back from the chamber;\nbut Jerome was too much agitated to be repulsed. He declared aloud the\nflight of Isabella, with protestations of his own innocence.\n\nManfred, distracted at the news, and not less at its coming to the\nknowledge of the strangers, uttered nothing but incoherent sentences, now\nupbraiding the Friar, now apologising to the Knights, earnest to know\nwhat was become of Isabella, yet equally afraid of their knowing;\nimpatient to pursue her, yet dreading to have them join in the pursuit.\nHe offered to despatch messengers in quest of her, but the chief Knight,\nno longer keeping silence, reproached Manfred in bitter terms for his\ndark and ambiguous dealing, and demanded the cause of Isabella\u2019s first\nabsence from the castle. Manfred, casting a stern look at Jerome,\nimplying a command of silence, pretended that on Conrad\u2019s death he had\nplaced her in sanctuary until he could determine how to dispose of her.\nJerome, who trembled for his son\u2019s life, did not dare contradict this\nfalsehood, but one of his brethren, not under the same anxiety, declared\nfrankly that she had fled to their church in the preceding night. The\nPrince in vain endeavoured to stop this discovery, which overwhelmed him\nwith shame and confusion.",
    "373": " The principal stranger, amazed at the\ncontradictions he heard, and more than half persuaded that Manfred had\nsecreted the Princess, notwithstanding the concern he expressed at her\nflight, rushing to the door, said\u2014\n\n\u201cThou traitor Prince! Isabella shall be found.\u201d\n\nManfred endeavoured to hold him, but the other Knights assisting their\ncomrade, he broke from the Prince, and hastened into the court, demanding\nhis attendants. Manfred, finding it vain to divert him from the pursuit,\noffered to accompany him and summoning his attendants, and taking Jerome\nand some of the Friars to guide them, they issued from the castle;\nManfred privately giving orders to have the Knight\u2019s company secured,\nwhile to the knight he affected to despatch a messenger to require their\nassistance.\n\nThe company had no sooner quitted the castle than Matilda, who felt\nherself deeply interested for the young peasant, since she had seen him\ncondemned to death in the hall, and whose thoughts had been taken up with\nconcerting measures to save him, was informed by some of the female\nattendants that Manfred had despatched all his men various ways in\npursuit of Isabella. He had in his hurry given this order in general\nterms, not meaning to extend it to the guard he had set upon Theodore,\nbut forgetting it. The domestics, officious to obey so peremptory a\nPrince, and urged by their own curiosity and love of novelty to join in\nany precipitate chase, had to a man left the castle.",
    "374": " Matilda disengaged\nherself from her women, stole up to the black tower, and unbolting the\ndoor, presented herself to the astonished Theodore.\n\n\u201cYoung man,\u201d said she, \u201cthough filial duty and womanly modesty condemn\nthe step I am taking, yet holy charity, surmounting all other ties,\njustifies this act. Fly; the doors of thy prison are open: my father and\nhis domestics are absent; but they may soon return. Be gone in safety;\nand may the angels of heaven direct thy course!\u201d\n\n\u201cThou art surely one of those angels!\u201d said the enraptured Theodore:\n\u201cnone but a blessed saint could speak, could act\u2014could look\u2014like thee.\nMay I not know the name of my divine protectress? Methought thou namedst\nthy father. Is it possible? Can Manfred\u2019s blood feel holy pity! Lovely\nLady, thou answerest not. But how art thou here thyself? Why dost thou\nneglect thy own safety, and waste a thought on a wretch like Theodore?\nLet us fly together: the life thou bestowest shall be dedicated to thy\ndefence.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlas! thou mistakest,\u201d said Matilda, sighing: \u201cI am Manfred\u2019s daughter,\nbut no dangers await me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmazement!\u201d said Theodore; \u201cbut last night I blessed myself for yielding\nthee the service thy gracious compassion so charitably returns me now.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill thou art in an error,\u201d said the Princess; \u201cbut this is no time for\nexplanation. Fly, virtuous youth, while it is in my power to save thee:\nshould my father return, thou and I both should indeed have cause to\ntremble.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow!\u201d said Theodore; \u201cthinkest thou, charming maid, that I will accept\nof life at the hazard of aught calamitous to thee? Better I endured a\nthousand deaths.\u201d\n\n\u201cI run no risk,\u201d said Matilda, \u201cbut by thy delay. Depart; it cannot be\nknown that I have assisted thy flight.\u201d\n\n\u201cSwear by the saints above,\u201d said Theodore, \u201cthat thou canst not be\nsuspected; else here I vow to await whatever can befall me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! thou art too generous,\u201d said Matilda; \u201cbut rest assured that no\nsuspicion can alight on me.",
    "375": "\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me thy beauteous hand in token that thou dost not deceive me,\u201d said\nTheodore; \u201cand let me bathe it with the warm tears of gratitude.\u201d\n\n\u201cForbear!\u201d said the Princess; \u201cthis must not be.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlas!\u201d said Theodore, \u201cI have never known but calamity until this\nhour\u2014perhaps shall never know other fortune again: suffer the chaste\nraptures of holy gratitude: \u2019tis my soul would print its effusions on thy\nhand.\u201d\n\n\u201cForbear, and be gone,\u201d said Matilda. \u201cHow would Isabella approve of\nseeing thee at my feet?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is Isabella?\u201d said the young man with surprise.\n\n\u201cAh, me!

Say but,\nadored Lady, that I have thy gentle pity.",
    "376": "\u201d\n\n\u201cStay,\u201d said Matilda; \u201cI will conduct thee to the subterraneous vault by\nwhich Isabella escaped; it will lead thee to the church of St. Nicholas,\nwhere thou mayst take sanctuary.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d said Theodore, \u201cwas it another, and not thy lovely self that I\nassisted to find the subterraneous passage?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was,\u201d said Matilda; \u201cbut ask no more; I tremble to see thee still\nabide here; fly to the sanctuary.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo sanctuary,\u201d said Theodore; \u201cno, Princess; sanctuaries are for\nhelpless damsels, or for criminals.

But could I gaze on thee, and remember thou art\nsprung from the tyrant Manfred! But he is thy father, and from this\nmoment my injuries are buried in oblivion.\u201d\n\nA deep and hollow groan, which seemed to come from above, startled the\nPrincess and Theodore.\n\n\u201cGood heaven! we are overheard!\u201d said the Princess. They listened; but\nperceiving no further noise, they both concluded it the effect of pent-up\nvapours. And the Princess, preceding Theodore softly, carried him to her\nfather\u2019s armoury, where, equipping him with a complete suit, he was\nconducted by Matilda to the postern-gate.\n\n\u201cAvoid the town,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cand all the western side of the\ncastle.",
    "377": " \u2019Tis there the search must be making by Manfred and the\nstrangers; but hie thee to the opposite quarter. Yonder behind that\nforest to the east is a chain of rocks, hollowed into a labyrinth of\ncaverns that reach to the sea coast. There thou mayst lie concealed,\ntill thou canst make signs to some vessel to put on shore, and take thee\noff. Go! heaven be thy guide!\u2014and sometimes in thy prayers\nremember\u2014Matilda!\u201d\n\nTheodore flung himself at her feet, and seizing her lily hand, which with\nstruggles she suffered him to kiss, he vowed on the earliest opportunity\nto get himself knighted, and fervently entreated her permission to swear\nhimself eternally her knight. Ere the Princess could reply, a clap of\nthunder was suddenly heard that shook the battlements. Theodore,\nregardless of the tempest, would have urged his suit: but the Princess,\ndismayed, retreated hastily into the castle, and commanded the youth to\nbe gone with an air that would not be disobeyed. He sighed, and retired,\nbut with eyes fixed on the gate, until Matilda, closing it, put an end to\nan interview, in which the hearts of both had drunk so deeply of a\npassion, which both now tasted for the first time.\n\nTheodore went pensively to the convent, to acquaint his father with his\ndeliverance. There he learned the absence of Jerome, and the pursuit\nthat was making after the Lady Isabella, with some particulars of whose\nstory he now first became acquainted. The generous gallantry of his\nnature prompted him to wish to assist her; but the Monks could lend him\nno lights to guess at the route she had taken. He was not tempted to\nwander far in search of her, for the idea of Matilda had imprinted itself\nso strongly on his heart, that he could not bear to absent himself at\nmuch distance from her abode. The tenderness Jerome had expressed for\nhim concurred to confirm this reluctance; and he even persua",
    "378": "ded himself\nthat filial affection was the chief cause of his hovering between the\ncastle and monastery.\n\nUntil Jerome should return at night, Theodore at length determined to\nrepair to the forest that Matilda had pointed out to him. Arriving\nthere, he sought the gloomiest shades, as best suited to the pleasing\nmelancholy that reigned in his mind. In this mood he roved insensibly to\nthe caves which had formerly served as a retreat to hermits, and were now\nreported round the country to be haunted by evil spirits. He recollected\nto have heard this tradition; and being of a brave and adventurous\ndisposition, he willingly indulged his curiosity in exploring the secret\nrecesses of this labyrinth. He had not penetrated far before he thought\nhe heard the steps of some person who seemed to retreat before him.\n\nTheodore, though firmly grounded in all our holy faith enjoins to be\nbelieved, had no apprehension that good men were abandoned without cause\nto the malice of the powers of darkness. He thought the place more\nlikely to be infested by robbers than by those infernal agents who are\nreported to molest and bewilder travellers. He had long burned with\nimpatience to approve his valour. Drawing his sabre, he marched sedately\nonwards, still directing his steps as the imperfect rustling sound before\nhim led the way. The armour he wore was a like indication to the person\nwho avoided him. Theodore, now convinced that he was not mistaken,\nredoubled his pace, and evidently gained on the person that fled, whose\nhaste increasing, Theodore came up just as a woman fell breathless before\nhim. He hasted to raise her, but her terror was so great that he\napprehended she would faint in his arms. He used every gentle word to\ndispel her alarms, and assured her that far from injuring, he would\ndefend her at the peril of his life.",
    "379": " The Lady recovering her spirits\nfrom his courteous demeanour, and gazing on her protector, said\u2014\n\n\u201cSure, I have heard that voice before!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot to my knowledge,\u201d replied Theodore; \u201cunless, as I conjecture, thou\nart the Lady Isabella.\u201d\n\n\u201cMerciful heaven!\u201d cried she. \u201cThou art not sent in quest of me, art\nthou?\u201d And saying those words, she threw herself at his feet, and\nbesought him not to deliver her up to Manfred.\n\n\u201cTo Manfred!\u201d cried Theodore\u2014\u201cno, Lady; I have once already delivered\nthee from his tyranny, and it shall fare hard with me now, but I will\nplace thee out of the reach of his daring.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it possible,\u201d said she, \u201cthat thou shouldst be the generous unknown\nwhom I met last night in the vault of the castle? Sure thou art not a\nmortal, but my guardian angel. On my knees, let me thank\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHold! gentle Princess,\u201d said Theodore, \u201cnor demean thyself before a poor\nand friendless young man. If heaven has selected me for thy deliverer,\nit will accomplish its work, and strengthen my arm in thy cause. But\ncome, Lady, we are too near the mouth of the cavern; let us seek its\ninmost recesses.

They soon distinguished these sounds\u2014\n\n\u201cIsabella! what, ho! Isabella!\u201d The trembling Princess relapsed into her\nformer agony of fear. Theodore endeavoured to encourage her, but in\nvain. He assured her he would die rather than suffer her to return under\nManfred\u2019s power; and begging her to remain concealed, he went forth to\nprevent the person in search of her from approaching.\n\nAt the mouth of the cavern he found an armed Knight, discoursing with a\npeasant, who assured him he had seen a lady enter the passes of the rock.\nThe Knight was preparing to seek her, when Theodore, placing himself in\nhis way, with his sword drawn, sternly forbad him at his peril to\nadvance.\n\n\u201cAnd who art thou, who darest to cross my way?\u201d said the Knight,\nhaughtily.\n\n\u201cOne who does not dare more than he will perform,\u201d said Theodore.\n\n\u201cI seek the Lady Isabella,\u201d said the Knight, \u201cand understand she has\ntaken refuge among these rocks.

    "381": "\u201d\n\nThe stranger, who was the principal Knight that had arrived from the\nMarquis of Vicenza, had galloped from Manfred as he was busied in getting\ninformation of the Princess, and giving various orders to prevent her\nfalling into the power of the three Knights. Their chief had suspected\nManfred of being privy to the Princess\u2019s absconding, and this insult from\na man, who he concluded was stationed by that Prince to secrete her,\nconfirming his suspicions, he made no reply, but discharging a blow with\nhis sabre at Theodore, would soon have removed all obstruction, if\nTheodore, who took him for one of Manfred\u2019s captains, and who had no\nsooner given the provocation than prepared to support it, had not\nreceived the stroke on his shield. The valour that had so long been\nsmothered in his breast broke forth at once; he rushed impetuously on the\nKnight, whose pride and wrath were not less powerful incentives to hardy\ndeeds. The combat was furious, but not long. Theodore wounded the\nKnight in three several places, and at last disarmed him as he fainted by\nthe loss of blood.\n\nThe peasant, who had fled on the first onset, had given the alarm to some\nof Manfred\u2019s domestics, who, by his orders, were dispersed through the\nforest in pursuit of Isabella. They came up as the Knight fell, whom\nthey soon discovered to be the noble stranger. Theodore, notwithstanding\nhis hatred to Manfred, could not behold the victory he had gained without\nemotions of pity and generosity. But he was more touched when he learned\nthe quality of his adversary, and was informed that he was no retainer,\nbut an enemy, of Manfred. He assisted the servants of the latter in\ndisarming the Knight, and in endeavouring to stanch the blood that flowed\nfrom his wounds.",

But her fears returned when she beheld the\ndomestics of Manfred. She would again have fled if Theodore had not made\nher observe that they were unarmed, and had not threatened them with\ninstant death if they should dare to seize the Princess.\n\nThe stranger, opening his eyes, and beholding a woman, said, \u201cArt\nthou\u2014pray tell me truly\u2014art thou Isabella of Vicenza?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d s",

    "384": " Sir, you will not abandon my child,\nwill you?\u201d\n\nTheodore, shedding tears over his victim, and vowing to guard the\nPrincess at the expense of his life, persuaded Frederic to suffer himself\nto be conducted to the castle. They placed him on a horse belonging to\none of the domestics, after binding up his wounds as well as they were\nable. Theodore marched by his side; and the afflicted Isabella, who\ncould not bear to quit him, followed mournfully behind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nThe sorrowful troop no sooner arrived at the castle, than they were met\nby Hippolita and Matilda, whom Isabella had sent one of the domestics\nbefore to advertise of their approach. The ladies causing Frederic to be\nconveyed into the nearest chamber, retired, while the surgeons examined\nhis wounds. Matilda blushed at seeing Theodore and Isabella together;\nbut endeavoured to conceal it by embracing the latter, and condoling with\nher on her father\u2019s mischance. The surgeons soon came to acquaint\nHippolita that none of the Marquis\u2019s wounds were dangerous; and that he\nwas desirous of seeing his daughter and the Princesses.",
    "385": "\n\nTheodore, under pretence of expressing his joy at being freed from his\napprehensions of the combat being fatal to Frederic, could not resist the\nimpulse of following Matilda. Her eyes were so often cast down on\nmeeting his, that Isabella, who regarded Theodore as attentively as he\ngazed on Matilda, soon divined who the object was that he had told her in\nthe cave engaged his affections. While this mute scene passed, Hippolita\ndemanded of Frederic the cause of his having taken that mysterious course\nfor reclaiming his daughter; and threw in various apologies to excuse her\nLord for the match contracted between their children.\n\nFrederic, however incensed against Manfred, was not insensible to the\ncourtesy and benevolence of Hippolita: but he was still more struck with\nthe lovely form of Matilda. Wishing to detain them by his bedside, he\ninformed Hippolita of his story. He told her that, while prisoner to the\ninfidels, he had dreamed that his daughter, of whom he had learned no\nnews since his captivity, was detained in a castle, where she was in\ndanger of the most dreadful misfortunes: and that if he obtained his\nliberty, and repaired to a wood near Joppa, he would learn more. Alarmed\nat this dream, and incapable of obeying the direction given by it, his\nchains became more grievous than ever. But while his thoughts were\noccupied on the means of obtaining his liberty, he received the agreeable\nnews that the confederate Princes who were warring in Palestine had paid\nhis ransom. He instantly set out for the wood that had been marked in\nhis dream.\n\nFor three days he and his attendants had wandered in the forest without\nseeing a human form: but on the evening of the third they came to a cell,\nin which they found a venerable hermit in the agonies of death.",

When first I repaired to this solitude, after seeing\nmy country become a prey to unbelievers\u2014it is alas! above fifty years\nsince I was witness to that dreadful scene! St. Nicholas appeared to me,\nand revealed a secret, which he bade me never disclose to mortal man, but\non my death-bed. This is that tremendous hour, and ye are no doubt the\nchosen warriors to whom I was ordered to reveal my trust. As soon as ye\nhave done the last offices to this wretched corse, dig under the seventh\ntree on the left hand of this poor cave, and your pains will\u2014Oh! good\nheaven receive my soul!\u201d With those words the devout man breathed his\nlast.\n\n\u201cBy break of day,\u201d continued Frederic, \u201cwhen we had committed the holy\nrelics to earth, we dug according to direction. But what was our\nastonishment when about the depth of six feet we discovered an enormous\nsabre\u2014the very weapon yonder in the court. On the blade, which was then\npartly out of the scabbard, though since closed by our efforts in\nremoving it, were written the following lines\u2014no; excuse me, Madam,\u201d\nadded the Marquis, turning to Hippolita; \u201cif I forbear to repeat them: I\nrespect your sex and rank, and would not be guilty of offending your ear\nwith sounds injurious to aught that is dear to you.\u201d\n\nHe paused. Hippolita trembled. She did not doubt but Frederic was\ndestined by heaven to accomplish the fate that seemed to threaten her\nhouse. Looking with anxious fondness at Matilda, a silent tear stole\ndown her cheek: but recollecting herself, she said\u2014\n\n\u201cProceed, my Lord; heaven does nothing in vain; mortals must receive its\ndivine behests with lowliness and submission.",

The dignity and\npatient firmness of Hippolita penetrated him with respect, and the tender\nsilent affection with which the Princess and her daughter regarded each\nother, melted him almost to tears. Yet apprehensive that his forbearance\nto obey would be more alarming, he repeated in a faltering and low voice\nthe following lines:\n\n    \u201cWhere\u2019er a casque that suits this sword is found,\n    With perils is thy daughter compass\u2019d round;\n    _Alfonso\u2019s_ blood alone can save the maid,\n    And quiet a long restless Prince\u2019s shade.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is there in these lines,\u201d said Theodore impatiently, \u201cthat affects\nthese Princesses? Why were they to be shocked by a mysterious delicacy,\nthat has so little foundation?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour words are rude, young man,\u201d said the Marquis; \u201cand though fortune\nhas favoured you once\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy honoured Lord,\u201d said Isabella, who resented Theodore\u2019s warmth, which\nshe perceived was dictated by his sentiments for Matilda, \u201cdiscompose not\nyourself for the glosing of a peasant\u2019s son: he forgets the reverence he\nowes you; but he is not accustomed\u2014\u201d\n\nHippolita, concerned at the heat that had arisen, ",

Manfred\nadvanced hastily towards Frederic\u2019s bed to condole with him on his\nmisfortune, and to learn the circumstances of the combat, when starting\nin an agony of terror and amazement, he cried\u2014\n\n\u201cHa! what art thou? thou dreadful spectre! is my hour come?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dearest, gracious Lord,\u201d cried Hippolita, clasping him in her arms,\n\u201cwhat is it you see!

They separated each to her chamber, with more expressions of\nceremony and fewer of affection than had passed between them since their\nchildhood.\n\nIf they parted with small cordiality, they did but meet with greater\nimpatience, as soon as the sun was risen. Their minds were in a\nsituation that excluded sleep, and each recollected a thousand questions\nwhich she wished she had put to the other overnight. Matilda reflected\nthat Isabella had been twice delivered by Theodore in very critical\nsituations, which she could not believe accidental.",
    "393": " His eyes, it was\ntrue, had been fixed on her in Frederic\u2019s chamber; but that might have\nbeen to disguise his passion for Isabella from the fathers of both. It\nwere better to clear this up. She wished to know the truth, lest she\nshould wrong her friend by entertaining a passion for Isabella\u2019s lover.\nThus jealousy prompted, and at the same time borrowed an excuse from\nfriendship to justify its curiosity.\n\nIsabella, not less restless, had better foundation for her suspicions.\nBoth Theodore\u2019s tongue and eyes had told her his heart was engaged; it\nwas true\u2014yet, perhaps, Matilda might not correspond to his passion; she\nhad ever appeared insensible to love: all her thoughts were set on\nheaven.\n\n\u201cWhy did I dissuade her?\u201d said Isabella to herself; \u201cI am punished for my\ngenerosity; but when did they meet? where? It cannot be; I have deceived\nmyself; perhaps last night was the first time they ever beheld each\nother; it must be some other object that has prepossessed his\naffections\u2014if it is, I am not so unhappy as I thought; if it is not my\nfriend Matilda\u2014how!

This attitude, so\ncorrespondent to what she felt herself, revived Isabella\u2019s suspicions,\nand destroyed the confidence she had purposed to place in her friend.\nThey blushed at meeting, and were too much novices to disguise their\nsensations with address. After some unmeaning questions and replies,\nMatilda demanded of Isabella the cause of her flight?

No, Matilda, my heart abhors him; and if you still retain the\nfriendship for me that you have vowed from your infancy, you will detest\na man who has been on the point of making me miserable for ever.\u201d\n\nMatilda held down her head and replied: \u201cI hope my dearest Isabella does\nnot doubt her Matilda\u2019s friendship: I never beheld that youth until\nyesterday; he is almost a stranger to me: but as the surgeons have\npronounced your father out of danger, you ought not to harbour\nuncharitable resentment against one, who I am persuaded did not know the\nMarquis was related to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou plead his cause very pathetically,\u201d said Isabella, \u201cconsidering he\nis so much a stranger to you!

These scruples concurred to make the separation\nfrom her husband appear less dreadful to her than it would have seemed in\nany other situation.\n\nJerome, at quitting the castle overnight, had questioned Theodore\nseverely why he had accused him to Manfred of being privy to his escape.\nTheodore owned it had been with design to prevent Manfred\u2019s suspicion\nfrom alighting on Matilda; and added, the holiness of Jerome\u2019s life and\ncharacter secured him from the tyrant\u2019s wrath.

The Friar caught eagerly at\nher request of his advice, and without explaining his aversion to the\nproposed marriage of Manfred and Isabella, he painted to Hippolita in the\nmost alarming colours the sinfulness of her consent, denounced judgments\nagainst her if she complied, and enjoined her in the severest terms to\ntreat any such proposition with every mark of indignation and refusal.\n\nManfred, in the meantime, had broken his purpose to Frederic, and\nproposed the double marriage.",

He made faint opposition\nto the proposal; affecting, for form only, not to acquiesce unless\nHippolita should consent to the divorce. Manfred took that upon himself.\n\nTransported with his success, and impatient to see himself in a situation\nto expect sons, he hastened to his wife\u2019s apartment, determined to extort\nher compliance. He learned with indignation that she was absent at the\nconvent. His guilt suggested to him that she had probably been informed\nby Isabella of his purpose.

But Jerome\u2019s new presumption, so dissonant from his former\nmeekness, suggested still deeper apprehensions. The Prince even\nsuspected that the Friar depended on some secret support from Frederic,\nwhose arrival, coinciding with the novel appearance of Theodore, seemed\nto bespeak a correspondence. Still more was he troubled with the\nresemblance of Theodore to Alfonso\u2019s portrait. The latter he knew had\nunquestionably died without issue. Frederic had consented to bestow\nIsabella on him. These contradictions agitated his mind with numberless\npangs.\n\nHe saw but two methods of extricating himself from his difficulties. The\none was to resign his dominions to the Marquis\u2014pride, ambition, and his\nreliance on ancient prophecies, which had pointed out a possibility of\nhis preserving them to his posterity, combated that thought. The other\nwas to press his marriage with Isabella. After long ruminating on these\nanxious thoughts, as he marched silently with Hippolita to the castle, he\nat last discoursed with that Princess on the subject of his disquiet, and\nused every insinuating and plausible argument to extract her consent to,\neven her promise of promoting the divorce. Hippolita needed little\npersuasions to bend her to his pleasure. She endeavoured to win him over\nto the measure of resigning his dominions; but finding her exhortations\nfruitless, she assured him, that as far as her conscience would allow,\nshe would raise no opposition to a separation, though without better\nfounded scruples than what he yet alleged, she would not engage to be\nactive in demanding it.\n\nThis compliance, though inadequate, was sufficient to raise Manfred\u2019s\nhopes. He trusted that his power and wealth would easily advance his\nsuit at the court of Rome, whither he resolved to engage Frederic to take\na journey on purpose.",

The judgments\nalready fallen on your house forbid me matching into it.\u201d\n\nManfred, alarmed at the resolute tone in which Frederic delivered these\nwords, endeavoured to pacify him. Dismissing Bianca, he made such\nsubmissions to the Marquis, and threw in such artful encomiums on\nMatilda, that Frederic was once more staggered. However, as his passion\nwas of so recent a date, it could not at once surmount the scruples he\nhad conceived. He had gathered enough from Bianca\u2019s discourse to\npersuade him that heaven declared itself against Manfred. The proposed\nmarriages too removed his claim to a distance; and the principality of\nOtranto was a stronger temptation than the contingent reversion of it\nwith Matilda. Still he would not absolutely recede from his engagements;\nbut purposing to gain time, he demanded of Manfred if it was true in fact\nthat Hippolita consented to the divorce. The Prince, transported to find\nno other obstacle, and depending on his influence over his wife, assured\nthe Marquis it was so, and that he might satisfy himself of the truth\nfrom her own mouth.\n\nAs they were thus discoursing, word was brought that the banquet was\nprepared. Manfred conducted Frederic to the great hall, where they were\nreceived by Hippolita and the young Princesses. Manfred placed the\nMarquis next to Matilda, and seated himself between his wife and\nIsabella. Hippolita comported herself with an easy gravity; but the\nyoung ladies were silent and melancholy.",
    "418": " Manfred, who was determined to\npursue his point with the Marquis in the remainder of the evening, pushed\non the feast until it waxed late; affecting unrestrained gaiety, and\nplying Frederic with repeated goblets of wine. The latter, more upon his\nguard than Manfred wished, declined his frequent challenges, on pretence\nof his late loss of blood; while the Prince, to raise his own disordered\nspirits, and to counterfeit unconcern, indulged himself in plentiful\ndraughts, though not to the intoxication of his senses.\n\nThe evening being far advanced, the banquet concluded. Manfred would\nhave withdrawn with Frederic; but the latter pleading weakness and want\nof repose, retired to his chamber, gallantly telling the Prince that his\ndaughter should amuse his Highness until himself could attend him.\nManfred accepted the party, and to the no small grief of Isabella,\naccompanied her to her apartment. Matilda waited on her mother to enjoy\nthe freshness of the evening on the ramparts of the castle.",

The\nMarquis, during the repast, had beheld Matilda with increase of passion.\nHe now wished to find Hippolita in the disposition her Lord had promised.\nThe portents that had alarmed him were forgotten in his desires.\nStealing softly and unobserved to the apartment of Hippolita, he entered\nit with a resolution to encourage her acquiescence to the divorce, having\nperceived that Manfred was resolved to make the possession of Isabella an\nunalterable condition, before he would grant Matilda to his wishes.\n\nThe Marquis was not surprised at the silence that reigned in the\nPrincess\u2019s apartment. Concluding her, as he had been advertised, in her\noratory, he passed on. The door was ajar; the evening gloomy and\novercast. Pushing open the door gently, he saw a person kneeling before\nthe altar.",

Then falling prostrate on his face before the altar, he\nbesought the intercession of every saint for pardon. A flood of tears\nsucceeded to this transport; and the image of the beauteous Matilda\nrushing in spite of him on his thoughts, he lay on the ground in a\nconflict of penitence and passion. Ere he could recover from this agony\nof his spirits, the Princess Hippolita with a taper in her hand entered\nthe oratory alone. Seeing a man without motion on the floor, she gave a\nshriek, concluding him dead.

Frederic, offended at an invitation so\ndissonant from the mood of his soul, pushed him rudely aside, and\nentering his chamber, flung the door intemperately against Manfred, and\nbolted it inwards. The haughty Prince, enraged at this unaccountable\nbehaviour, withdrew in a frame of mind capable of the most fatal\nexcesses. As he crossed the court, he was met by the domestic whom he\nhad planted at the convent as a spy on Jerome and Theodore. This man,\nalmost breathless with the haste he had made, informed his Lord that\nTheodore, and some lady from the castle were, at that instant, in private\nconference at the tomb of Alfonso in St.",
    "423": " Nicholas\u2019s church. He had\ndogged Theodore thither, but the gloominess of the night had prevented\nhis discovering who the woman was.\n\nManfred, whose spirits were inflamed, and whom Isabella had driven from\nher on his urging his passion with too little reserve, did not doubt but\nthe inquietude she had expressed had been occasioned by her impatience to\nmeet Theodore. Provoked by this conjecture, and enraged at her father,\nhe hastened secretly to the great church. Gliding softly between the\naisles, and guided by an imperfect gleam of moonshine that shone faintly\nthrough the illuminated windows, he stole towards the tomb of Alfonso, to\nwhich he was directed by indistinct whispers of the persons he sought.\nThe first sounds he could distinguish were\u2014\n\n\u201cDoes it, alas! depend on me? Manfred will never permit our union.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this shall prevent it!\u201d cried the tyrant, drawing his dagger, and\nplunging it over her shoulder into the bosom of the person that spoke.\n\n\u201cAh, me, I am slain!\u201d cried Matilda, sinking. \u201cGood heaven, receive my\nsoul!\u201d\n\n\u201cSavage, inhuman monster, what hast thou done!\u201d cried Theodore, rushing\non him, and wrenching his dagger from him.\n\n\u201cStop, stop thy impious hand!\u201d cried Matilda; \u201cit is my father!\u201d\n\nManfred, waking as from a trance, beat his breast, twisted his hands in\nhis locks, and endeavoured to recover his dagger from Theodore to\ndespatch himself. Theodore, scarce less distracted, and only mastering\nthe transports of his grief to assist Matilda, had now by his cries drawn\nsome of the monks to his aid.",
    "424": " While part of them endeavoured, in concert\nwith the afflicted Theodore, to stop the blood of the dying Princess, the\nrest prevented Manfred from laying violent hands on himself.\n\nMatilda, resigning herself patiently to her fate, acknowledged with looks\nof grateful love the zeal of Theodore. Yet oft as her faintness would\npermit her speech its way, she begged the assistants to comfort her\nfather. Jerome, by this time, had learnt the fatal news, and reached the\nchurch. His looks seemed to reproach Theodore, but turning to Manfred,\nhe said,\n\n\u201cNow, tyrant! behold the completion of woe fulfilled on thy impious and\ndevoted head! The blood of Alfonso cried to heaven for vengeance; and\nheaven has permitted its altar to be polluted by assassination, that thou\nmightest shed thy own blood at the foot of that Prince\u2019s sepulchre!\u201d\n\n\u201cCruel man!\u201d cried Matilda, \u201cto aggravate the woes of a parent; may\nheaven bless my father, and forgive him as I do! My Lord, my gracious\nSire, dost thou forgive thy child? Indeed, I came not hither to meet\nTheodore. I found him praying at this tomb, whither my mother sent me to\nintercede for thee, for her\u2014dearest father, bless your child, and say you\nforgive her.\u201d\n\n\u201cForgive thee!

Will you comfort her,\nmy Lord? Will you not put her away? Indeed she loves you! Oh, I am\nfaint! bear me to the castle. Can I live to have her close my eyes?\u201d\n\nTheodore and the monks besought her earnestly to suffer herself to be\nborne into the convent; but her instances were so pressing to be carried\nto the castle, that placing her on a litter, they conveyed her thither as\nshe requested.",
    "425": " Theodore, supporting her head with his arm, and hanging\nover her in an agony of despairing love, still endeavoured to inspire her\nwith hopes of life. Jerome, on the other side, comforted her with\ndiscourses of heaven, and holding a crucifix before her, which she bathed\nwith innocent tears, prepared her for her passage to immortality.\nManfred, plunged in the deepest affliction, followed the litter in\ndespair.\n\nEre they reached the castle, Hippolita, informed of the dreadful\ncatastrophe, had flown to meet her murdered child; but when she saw the\nafflicted procession, the mightiness of her grief deprived her of her\nsenses, and she fell lifeless to the earth in a swoon. Isabella and\nFrederic, who attended her, were overwhelmed in almost equal sorrow.\nMatilda alone seemed insensible to her own situation: every thought was\nlost in tenderness for her mother.\n\nOrdering the litter to stop, as soon as Hippolita was brought to herself,\nshe asked for her father. He approached, unable to speak. Matilda,\nseizing his hand and her mother\u2019s, locked them in her own, and then\nclasped them to her heart. Manfred could not support this act of\npathetic piety. He dashed himself on the ground, and cursed the day he\nwas born. Isabella, apprehensive that these struggles of passion were\nmore than Matilda could support, took upon herself to order Manfred to be\nborne to his apartment, while she caused Matilda to be conveyed to the\nnearest chamber. Hippolita, scarce more alive than her daughter, was\nregardless of everything but her; but when the tender Isabella\u2019s care\nwould have likewise removed her, while the surgeons examined Matilda\u2019s\nwound, she cried,\n\n\u201cRemove me! never, never! I lived but in her, and will expire with her.\u201d\n\nMatilda raised her eyes at her mother\u2019s voice, but closed them again\nwithout speaking.",

A clap of thunder at\nthat instant shook the castle to its foundations; the earth rocked, and\nthe clank of more than mortal armour was heard behind. Frederic and\nJerome thought the last day was at hand. The latter, forcing Theodore\nalong with them, rushed into the court. The moment Theodore appeared,\nthe walls of the castle behind Manfred were thrown down with a mighty\nforce, and the form of Alfonso, dilated to an immense magnitude, appeared\nin the centre of the ruins.\n\n\u201cBehold in Theodore the true heir of Alfonso!\u201d said the vision: And\nhaving pronounced those words, accompanied by a clap of thunder, it\nascended solemnly towards heaven, where the clouds parting asunder, the\nform of St. Nicholas was seen, and receiving Alfonso\u2019s shade, they were\nsoon wrapt from mortal eyes in a blaze of glory.\n\nThe beholders fell prostrate on their faces, acknowledging the divine\nwill. The first that broke silence was Hippolita.\n\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d said she to the desponding Manfred, \u201cbehold the vanity of\nhuman greatness! Conrad is gone! Matilda is no more! In Theodore we\nview the true Prince of Otranto.",
    "429": " By what miracle he is so I know\nnot\u2014suffice it to us, our doom is pronounced! shall we not, can we but\ndedicate the few deplorable hours we have to live, in deprecating the\nfurther wrath of heaven? heaven ejects us\u2014whither can we fly, but to yon\nholy cells that yet offer us a retreat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThou guiltless but unhappy woman! unhappy by my crimes!\u201d replied\nManfred, \u201cmy heart at last is open to thy devout admonitions. Oh!\ncould\u2014but it cannot be\u2014ye are lost in wonder\u2014let me at last do justice on\nmyself! To heap shame on my own head is all the satisfaction I have left\nto offer to offended heaven. My story has drawn down these judgments:\nLet my confession atone\u2014but, ah! what can atone for usurpation and a\nmurdered child? a child murdered in a consecrated place? List, sirs, and\nmay this bloody record be a warning to future tyrants!\u201d\n\n\u201cAlfonso, ye all know, died in the Holy Land\u2014ye would interrupt me; ye\nwould say he came not fairly to his end\u2014it is most true\u2014why else this\nbitter cup which Manfred must drink to the dregs. Ricardo, my\ngrandfather, was his chamberlain\u2014I would draw a veil over my ancestor\u2019s\ncrimes\u2014but it is in vain! Alfonso died by poison. A fictitious will\ndeclared Ricardo his heir. His crimes pursued him\u2014yet he lost no Conrad,\nno Matilda! I pay the price of usurpation for all! A storm overtook\nhim.",
    "430": " Haunted by his guilt he vowed to St. Nicholas to found a church and\ntwo convents, if he lived to reach Otranto. The sacrifice was accepted:\nthe saint appeared to him in a dream, and promised that Ricardo\u2019s\nposterity should reign in Otranto until the rightful owner should be\ngrown too large to inhabit the castle, and as long as issue male from\nRicardo\u2019s loins should remain to enjoy it\u2014alas! alas! nor male nor\nfemale, except myself, remains of all his wretched race! I have done\u2014the\nwoes of these three days speak the rest. How this young man can be\nAlfonso\u2019s heir I know not\u2014yet I do not doubt it. His are these\ndominions; I resign them\u2014yet I knew not Alfonso had an heir\u2014I question\nnot the will of heaven\u2014poverty and prayer must fill up the woeful space,\nuntil Manfred shall be summoned to Ricardo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat remains is my part to declare,\u201d said Jerome. \u201cWhen Alfonso set\nsail for the Holy Land he was driven by a storm to the coast of Sicily.\nThe other vessel, which bore Ricardo and his train, as your Lordship must\nhave heard, was separated from him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is most true,\u201d said Manfred; \u201cand the title you give me is more than\nan outcast can claim\u2014well! be it so\u2014proceed.\u201d\n\nJerome blushed, and continued. \u201cFor three months Lord Alfonso was\nwind-bound in Sicily. There he became enamoured of a fair virgin named\nVictoria. He was too pious to tempt her to forbidden pleasures. They\nwere married. Yet deeming this amour incongruous with the holy vow of\narms by which he was bound, he determined to conceal their nuptials until\nhis return from the Crusade, when he purposed to seek and acknowledge her\nfor his lawful wife. He left her pregnant. During his absence she was\ndelivered of a daughter. But scarce had she felt a mother\u2019s pangs ere\nshe heard the fatal rumour of her Lord\u2019s death, and the succession of\nRicardo.",
    "431": " What could a friendless, helpless woman do? Would her\ntestimony avail?\u2014yet, my lord, I have an authentic writing\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt needs not,\u201d said Manfred; \u201cthe horrors of these days, the vision we\nhave but now seen, all corroborate thy evidence beyond a thousand\nparchments. Matilda\u2019s death and my expulsion\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBe composed, my Lord,\u201d said Hippolita; \u201cthis holy man did not mean to\nrecall your griefs.\u201d Jerome proceeded.\n\n\u201cI shall not dwell on what is needless. The daughter of which Victoria\nwas delivered, was at her maturity bestowed in marriage on me. Victoria\ndied; and the secret remained locked in my breast. Theodore\u2019s narrative\nhas told the rest.\u201d\n\nThe Friar ceased. The disconsolate company retired to the remaining part\nof the castle. In the morning Manfred signed his abdication of the\nprincipality, with the approbation of Hippolita, and each took on them\nthe habit of religion in the neighbouring convents. Frederic offered his\ndaughter to the new Prince, which Hippolita\u2019s tenderness for Isabella\nconcurred to promote. But Theodore\u2019s grief was too fresh to admit the\nthought of another love; and it was not until after frequent discourses\nwith Isabella of his dear Matilda, that he was persuaded he could know no\nhappiness but in the society of one with whom he could for ever indulge\nthe melancholy that had taken possession of his soul."
