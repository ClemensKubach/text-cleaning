    "3": "The superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not be buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the vampiresnigh-nightly imbodiesed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumption; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and their veins became distended to such a state of completion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their badies, and even from the ucry pores of their skins.",
    "4": "The investigation into vampirism in Hungary was conducted by the London Journal of March 1732. A case of vampirism, reportedly occurring at Madraga, Hungary, was detailed, with the commander-in-chief and magistrates unanimously affirming that a certain Heyduke, Arnold Paul, had been accused of cursing the vampire and attempting to rid himself of it by consuming the vampire\u2019s earth. This practice, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself, and about twenty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being tormented by him, and a deposition was made that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants consulted their Hadagi, took the body, and found it (as is usual in vampire cemeteries) fresh and free from corruption, emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears pure and foul blood. Proof of this was obtained, and they resorted to the usual remedy \u2013 a stake driven through the body, which Arnold Paul reportedly cried out in terror. This was followed by the head being cut off, burned, and the remains thrown into the grave. The same measures were adopted with those who had previously died from vampirism, to prevent them from harming others who survived them."
