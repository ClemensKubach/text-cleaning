    "4": "\u201cThe London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious account of a particular case of vampyrifin, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been accused to have said that, at Cassovia, the front of the Turkish Servio, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre\u2019s grove, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been deprived of life by his attacks.\u201d To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (a\u017f is supposed to be usual in cafes of uampyrism) fresh, and entjrely free from corruptjon, and emitting at the mouth, riose, and ears, pure and fIorid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely lhrough the bearl and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to hauecried out cls dreadfully as is he had been olive. This done, they cut ofs his head, burned his body, and threw lhe asbes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses of th ose persons who had previously dicd from varnpyrism, lest they should, in theirturn, become clgentf upan others who survived them.",

    "12": "IT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the variovs partles af lhe leaders of the ton anobleman, inore rcmarkable for his singularitjes, thcln his ran k. He gazed upon the mirth arourid him, as if he could not partielpate therein. Apporently, the light laughter of the fair orily attracted his attention, that he might by a loak quoll it, and throw fear into those breasts where th0ughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensalion of awe,could nat cxplajn whencc it arose: some attrihuted itt0 the dead grey eye, which, fixing upori the object's face, did nat seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the oheek with a leaden ray lhclt weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiclritios caused bim t0 be invited to every bou fe; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent exciteinent, and now felt the weight af en nui, were pleased at having somelhing in their preserice capable of engaging their attentian. In spite of the deadly hue 0f his foce, which neuor gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or srom the strong emotion of passiori, lhough its form and outline were beautiful, many of thc fcmale hunters after natoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gclin, ot leasl, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who bad been tbe mockery of euery monster shewn in drawing-rooms \u017fince her marriage, threw herse1f in his way, and did all but put an the dress of a mauntebank, to attract his not ice:\u2014thoughin vain:\u2014when fhe stood before him, though his eyes were apparonlly fixed upon her 's, \u017ftill it seemed as lf they were unperceived;\u2014evcn her unappalled iinpudonce wels baffled, and she left the fiold. But though the common addressess could not inflvence everi the guidancc of hi\u017f eyos, it was not that tbe female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was tho apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent davghter, that few knew hecver addressed himself to semaIos. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whelher it was that it even ouercarne the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as ofteri among those females who form the boast ofjr sex from their domestic virtues, as amang tho\u017fe who sully it by their vices.",
    "13": "Ahout the \u017fame time, there cclme to Lond0n a yourig gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died whlle he was yet jn childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it tbeir duty merely to take care of hls fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind lo tbe care of mercenary suballerns, he cultivated more his imagination than hi\u017f judgment. He had, hence, that highromantic feelirig of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with uirtue, and thought vico was thrown in by Providence merely for the pictvresque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage morely consisted in the vcsting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to tho painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, jn sine, that the dreams os poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frarik, and rieh: for lhese reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers svrrounded bim,striving which shovld describe wlth least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daug-\nher\u017f at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, whenbo opened his lips, s0on led him into false notions of his talenls and his merit. Attached as he was to the ram ance of hif solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax cclndles that flickered, not from the presencc of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundalion in recll life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions coritained in those volumes, from whjch he had formed his study. extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.",
    "14": "He watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that slattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassing, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Street, that he was about to travel. Desired of gaining some informalion respecting this sirigular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform. taur, which for many generations had been too long necessary to enable young to take some rapid steps in the career of youth to be like the old, and not allowing them to appear as if falling from the skies, whenever scaridalovs intrigues were mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, accordingly to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Avbrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthveri, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Fla-ttered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling water.",
    "15": "Hitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven\u2019s character, and now he found, that though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was copious in his generosity;\u2014the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the vicious, reduced to irresponsibility by the missesportunes attendant even upon virtue, that he beslowed his claims;\u2014these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the prodigal came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the vicious indigent. There was ono circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the downfall, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the entrance of all fashionable venues; there he entered into the spirit of the faro table: he bet, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around; it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish feemed fortune's law\u2014this apparent abstracledness of mind wcls Iaid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the hal f-dead mouse. In every town, he left tbe formerly affluenl youth, torn from the circle he adorncd, cur\u017fing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the sate that had drawn him within the reaeh os this fiend; wbilst many a father sat fraritic, clmidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immen\u017fe wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to fcltisfy thelr present craving. Yet ho took no money from thc gambling table; bvt immediatoly lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the conuulsive grasp of theinnooent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was riot, however, capable of ooinbatirig tbe eunning of the more exp- Aubrey often wisbed to represent tbj\u017f to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of aIl, and dld not terid to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he h0ped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, tbis never occurrcd. Lord Ruthuen in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the samo: hi\u017f eye spoke less than his lip; and thougb Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtajned no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of voinly wishing to break tbat rny\u017ftery, which t0 his exalted imagination bcgan to assumo the appearance of something svpernalural.",
    "16": "They s0on arrived at Romc, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he wa\u2019 thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guards, the latter astonished him; if it had been stronger, he would have entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guards insisted upon his immediate departure from his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required... to erihance his gratification, that his vjclim, the partner of his guilt, shovld be hurled from the pinnclcIe of vnsullicd virtue, dowri to the lowest abyss of infamy and dogradation: in fine, thal all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, hod, since his departvre, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to tbe public gaze.",
    "17": "Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about about to meet her thal uery night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his inlentions were such as he supposed clll would have upon such an occasion; and upon b eing pressed wbether he intended to marry her, laughcd. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that fram that moment he must declirie accompanyjnghis L0rdship in the remainder of tbeir proposed tour, he orderod his servarit to seek other apartments, and calling upon tho rnother of the lady, inf orined her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent hi\u017f scrvant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion ofhis plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.",
    "18": "\u201cHe then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaughter, had hidden themselve beneath the sheltering soil or many colored lichen. Under the same roof as hersel, excited a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have sworn the model for a painter wishing to portray the promised hope of the saints in Mahomet\u2019s paradise, saying that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls.\u201d to the taste of an epicure. Tbe light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often wovld the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kafhmere bulterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, sloatirig as it were upon the wind, to thc eager gazc of him, who forgot lhe letters he had jvst decypbcred upori an almosl effaced ta6let, in the contemplation of her sylph-Iike figure. Oflen would her tresses falIing, as she flitted around, exhibit in the s un's ray such delica tely brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antjquary, who lel escape from his mirid the very objecl he had before thaughl of vital importance to the proper interpretation os a passage in Pausanias.

Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampire, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest relatives, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely semical to prolong his existence for the ensuing months.\u201d his blood would run cold, whilst attempted to laugh her out of such id1e and horrible fantasles; but Ianthe cited to him the riames os oldrnen, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their relatives and children marked with the stamp of the fiend\u2019s appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof giveri, which obligated them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance os these monsters, and his horror was increased by hoaring a pretty accurate description os Lord Rulhven; he, however, still persisted in persucling her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the mariy coincidence which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthuen.",
    "19": "Aubrey began to talk to himself more, more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself often from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the surroundings, while in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank and simple being he had first known. She always seemed to pleasure from him with such clarity; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some sragmenl which bad yet escapcd the destructive hand of time. Shc had appeaIed ta her parents on the subject of Vampyres, andthey both, with sevcr al prefent, affirmed their existence, pole with horror at the very name.

When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly heged os him to returri, ere night allowed the power os these boirigs to be put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon dawn, and that ln the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gathered into a tremendous mass, and paur aIl their rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, bowing, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late.

    "21": "Aubrey being Pvt to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in the intervals he would appear before Lord Ruthvcn and upon Ianthe\u2014hy some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would predict maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chance at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of the image whom he now had with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kindly words, implied almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. mirid, and Aubrey perceiued no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon her, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smiled haunted him.\u201d",

His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain thal she intrcated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt condu ct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her.

InstantlyAubrey's attenlion was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of whlch tbey feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking thif was a young Earl whom he had met with in sociely, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing bis iritontiori to be presenl at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sist er. They answered not, but in a few minutes his fister was with him.

Where he heard of Aubrey\u2019s illness, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by consistent attendance and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his welfare, gradually wore the ear of Miss Avery. Who could resist his power?

He asked for a pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own brother, and the honor of those now in the grave, to delay but for how long that marriage, on which she denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the names of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear.

The beauty of this place, and the certainty of cattle and vegetables always to be there there, induced many British vessels to visit it\u2014both men of war and merchants; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself to0k a ramble to the cave called Homer\u2019s School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as over guide, who told us he held come from Scio with an English lord, who had left the island days before our arrival in his fleet. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Milylene, where I am likely to get married. He was odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old mill in Chesterfield of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he is in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"",

We were kindly recejved by an old man, who conducted us over the mansiori. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor\u2014an entrclnce hall, a drawing-room, a silting parlovr, and a6ed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle ln the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the surniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairf, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, a prior a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a largo mattress spread an the floor, with two stuffed cotlon quilts and a pillow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece.

I once did him a service, and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechin rubles which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the woods, and whom the lord brought her from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"",

The roof, surroundedby a light slone balustrade, was covered by a fine Tvrkey earpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most os thc housc-tops are thuf furni\u017fhed, af upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.",
    "43": "On the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges, and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed merry of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying,\" for he was very devoted, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"",
    "44": "The view from this seat, what may defined \u201ca bird\u2019s-eye view.\u201d A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount CalcIa, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woads north of the mountain\u2019s base. The sea was smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminated the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty oaks and palm trees, several small islands were distinguished distinctly, shining the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \u201cThe Armeniari,\u201d said over counsel, \u201ccould tell, but I am sure he will not,\u201d\u2014\u201cAnd cannot you tell, old friend?\u201d con,\" sald he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on over return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and oven danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a newboat for a fishermari who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave GreekTestamonts to the paor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. Ono circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the toilette thought proper not to dislose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lard was often seen walking on the sea-sbore, and he hod bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.",

He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and alI those eccenlrioities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our dovhtf were dispelled. FaIlingin compony with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been lravelling in Egypt andGreece, \"The indivjdual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byrori; I mel him in my travols on the ifland of Tenedos, arid I al\u017fo visited hirn at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordsbip's fame, as we bad been some years fram home; but \"Chi1de Harolde\" being put into our hond\u017f we recognized the recluse of Calcla in overy page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we corisolcd ourselvef with the idea of returning t0 Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite interesting, and in justice to his lordship\u2019s good regime, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to soothe its follies, or adding to its pleasures. The fact is directly as follows: all the finer feelings of the heart, as elegantly depicted in his lordship\u2019s poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions; and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart religion hath set her seal, and over whosehead benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \u201ctraits\u201d without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasuros, I do not assume a right to give an oplnion. Reports are ever tobe received with caut-\nion, pclrticularly wheri directed against man'\u017f moral integrity; arid be w dares juslify bimself beforc that awful tribunal where all must appear, cllone may censure the errors os a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good insecret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony 0f a virtuous heart andself-approving conscierice.",
