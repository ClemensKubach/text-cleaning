    "3": "The superstition upon which this treatise is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it appears to be common that it did not extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not be buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. The vile miasma spread across Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the camps existed, and that horrifying nightmarish impelled a portion of the victims\u2019 blood. They became emaciated, lost their strength, and swiftly died of consumption. While these human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and their veins became bloated to such a state of completion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies and even from the orifices of their skins.",
    "4": "In the London Journal of March, 1732, a curious account of a particular case of vampirism, which is stated to have occurred at Madraga, in Hungary, is reported. The commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place positively and unanimously affirmed that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke had been accused to say that at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Empire, he had been accused to say that he had been tormented by a vampire, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire\u2019s grove, and rubbing himself with his blood. This man, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. The inhabitants having consulted their holy book, found it fresh and free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, forehead, and ears, pure and cold blood. They resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was driven entirely through Arnold Paul\u2019s body, at which he reportedly cried out greatly as he had been olive. They cut off his head, burned his body, and threw ashes into his grave. The measures were adopted with the concerns of those who had previously abandoned varnpyrism, lest they should become callous toward others who survived them."
