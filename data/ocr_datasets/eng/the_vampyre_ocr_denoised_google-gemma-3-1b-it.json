    "3": "The superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it appeared to be common: it did not extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches. At that time, the idea becoming prevalent that a Latin body could not survive if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the vampires mysteriously infested a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumption; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and their veins became distended to such a state of completeness, as to cause... explanations.\n\n\u201cBlood sucks\u2014and their veins became distended to such a state of completion, causing the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies and even from the orifices of their skins.\u201d",
    "4": "In the London Journal of March 1732, there is a curious account of a particular case of vampirism, which is stated to have occurred at Madra, in Hungary. It appears that upon examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed that, about five years prior, a certain Duke, named Arnold Paul, had been accused of saying that at Cassovia, the front of the Turkish forces had been tormented by a vampire, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil by eating some of the earth from the vampire\u2019s grove, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming the vampire himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. was accused by others of murdering four people by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants who had consulted their agni (or horoscope) took the body, and found it fresh, entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and red blood. Proof of this was obtained, and they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was driven through the bear and body of Arnold Paul, and he is reported to have cried dreadfully as he had been olive. This was done, and then their heads were cut off, burned their bodies, and the remains were thrown into their grave. The same measures were adopted with those who had previously died from varivpyrism, lest they should, in turn, become contemptible towards others who survived them.\u201d",

    "7": "This monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems less adapted to illustrate the subject of these present observations than any other difference could be adduced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a sort of punishment after dobt, for some heathen crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampirize, but compelled to confine his infernal visions solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom he was bound by ties of kindness and affection.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"",
    "8": "But first on earth, as Vampyre sent, thy corpse shall be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood of all thy race. There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the stream of life; Yet let be the banquet which perforee, must feed thy livid living corpse, thy victims, ore they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their fire; As conquering thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, the youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father\u2019s name \u2013 that word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yel thou must end thy task and inark her cheek\u2019s last tinge \u2013 her eye\u2019s last spark, And the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unbowed hand shalt tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock whence affection\u2019s fondest pledge was worn \u2013 But now is borne away by thee, Memorial of thine. Yet with thine own best blood shalt drip; Thy is borne away by thee, Memorial of anguish! Yet with thine own blood shall drip. Thy gnashing tooth, and bagard lip; Then standing to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014arid with gulls and Afrits rave, Till thefe in horror shrink away From spectacle more accursed than they.\u201d",
    "9": "Mr. Southey introduced his wild ballad \"Thalaba,\" the vampire corpse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave to torment her best loved while in existence. This cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinful nature of her life; she is portrayed throughout the whole tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracity of the Tourncf0rt gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampirism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides anecdotes and traditional narratives illustrating its effects, has put forth some learned disagreements, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.",
    "10": "Many curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition may be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessary for explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vrouco1ocha, Vardou1acba, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.",

Those who felt this sensation of awe could not explain when it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object\u2019s face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin, it could not pass.

Despite the deadly hue of his force, which neuron gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after attempting to win his attentions tried to win his affections: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shown in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put herself in the dress of a mountainbank, to attract his attention; though in vain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her, still it seemed as if they were unseen; even her appalled indifference words baffled, and she left the field.\u201d explanations.\n\n\u201cDespite being unseen, even her unappeased eyes were baffled, and she left the field. Though the common address could not influence ever the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him; yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to semas. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; whether it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was often among those females who formed the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\u201d",
    "13": "The same time, there came to London a gentleman named Aubrey: he was an orphan left with only a sister in possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. He was left to himself by guardians, who thought their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary sub-ventures. He cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had that highromantic feeling of honor and candor, which daily ruins so many milliner's apprentices. He believed all to sympathize with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances; he thought that the misery of a cottage was merely consisting in the wounding of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various colored patches. was better adapted to the painter\u2019s eye than anyone else because of their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in sin, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, fair, and rich; for these reasons, upon entering the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving with the least truth to describe their languishing or romping favorites. The daughter, at the same time, by their brightening faces when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached to the ramance of his solitary hours, he was startled to find that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, there was no foundation in life for such a collection of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study.\u201d from them. Finding, however, some compensation for his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams when the extraordinary being we have described, crossed him in his career.",
    "14": "He watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of a man\u2019s character entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that slattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the likeness of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became attached to him, paid him attentions, and so advanced upon his notice that his presence was always recognized. Gradually, he learned that Lord Ruthven\u2019s affairs were embarrassing, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Street, that he was about to travel. Desired of gaining some informalion regarding this sirigular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians that it was time for him to perform the taur. the curiosity of his mind, he hinted to his guardians that it was time for him to perform the taur, which for many generations had been thoroughly necessary to enable young men to take some rapid steps in the career of justice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the old, and not allowing them to appear as if from the skies. Whenever scaralovs intrigues were mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, accordingly to the degree of skill shown in carrying them on. They consented: and Avbrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthveri, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling water.\u201d",
    "15": "Here's the cleaned and denoised text:\n\n\u201cPreviously, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthven\u2019s character, and now he found that though many of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives for his conduct. His companion was generous in his generosity; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. However, Aubrey could not avoid remarking that it was not upon the vicious, reduced to idleness and misfortune, that he based his claims;\u2014these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers. But when the prodigal came to ask something, not to relieve his needs, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him further into his inequity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the vicious.\u201d the viciousness that generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the vicious indigent. There was one circumstance about his Lordship, which was still more impressive upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to suffering, or sunk to the lowest and most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought the centers of all fashionable venues; he entered into the spirit of the faro table; he bet, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around; it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish. \u2013 this apparent abstruseness of mind ceased, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of a cat while dallying with the hal fox-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the state that had drawn him within the reach of this friend; while many a father sat far away, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruin of many, the last gilt he had just snatched from the clutches of the insolent; this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not capable of overcoming the cunning of the more experienced. explanations.\n\n\u201cKnowledge, which was not, however, capable of inspiring the experience of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent it to his friend, and begged him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not try to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him. However, this never occurred. Lord Ruthuen in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of wondering to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\u201d",
    "16": "They soon arrived at Romc, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, while he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guards, the latter astonished him; if it had been stronger, he would have believed that there was an evil power residing in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guards insisted upon his immediate departure from his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character, but that he had required\u2026 had required to enhance his gratification that his husband, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of sullicenced virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in that, all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had since his departure thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.",
    "17": "Aubrey determined upon leaving one whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest his eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext to abandon him altogether, intending to watch him more closely and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoted. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavoring to work upon the experience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it was seldom that an unmarried female was met with in society; he was therefore obliged to marry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey\u2019s eye followed him in all his winding ways, and soon discovered that an assignment had been appointed, which would most likely and in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the Lord Ruthven\u2019s apartment and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such as he thought would be upon such an occasion, and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, he laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note to say that from that moment he must declare that accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his service to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey\u2019s intervention.",
    "18": "Having least Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records and ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaughtering them, had hidden themself beneath the sheltering soil or many colored lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate that she might have formed the model for a painter to portray the promised hope of the stateful in Muhammad's paradise, saying that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle was a poor typeof hers; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but... explanations.\n\n\u201cEye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animaI suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kafhmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, shimmering as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just deciphered upori an almost erased tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Oflen would her tresses fall, as she flitted around, exhibiting in the sun\u2019s ray such delicate brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mirid the very object he had before thought vital to the proper interpretation as a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded.\u201d crowded drawing-rooms and lavish balls. While he drew the remains of which he wished to preserve for his future hours, she would stand by and watch the magic effects of his pencil, tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, and paint, to him in all the glowing colors of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subject that had evidentIy made a greater impression upon her mind, she would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampire, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest relatives, forced every year by feeding upon the life of a lovely semilife to prolong his existence for the ensuing months.\u201d months, his blood would run cold; while attempted to laugh her out of such ideas and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited Rheumatic Osold, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their relatives and children found marked with the stamp of the fiend\u2019s appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence had some proof giver, which obligated them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Rulhven; he, however, still persisted in pursuing her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the marvelous coincidence which had all... truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the mysterious circumstances which had all tended to exclude a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthuen.\u201d",
    "19": "Aubrey began to attoch himself more deeply, and to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart. While he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself often from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained. But he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the surroundings, while in his mind, he retained an image that seemed to be alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank and innocent being he had first known. She always seemed to pleasure from him with such clarity; but it was because she had no one with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, whilst her guardian. had longer anyone with whom you could visit your favorite haunts; while your guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some strange relics which had escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appeared to her parents on the subject of vampires, and they both, with several preventative, affirmed their existence, profoundly horrified at the very name. Soori after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions; which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to dissuade them from the idea.\u201d to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.",

He was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse and earnestly begged him to return, before night allowed the power of these birds to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in these warm climates, so rapidly gathered into a tremendous mass, and paraded all their rage upon the devoted country. At last, however, he mounted his horse and determined to make up by speed for his delay; but it was too late.

Suddenly, his horse took right, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a bundle that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the hundreds, for a moment, silenced, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery as a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the\u2026\u201d was a mockery, an awful laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled, but, roused by the thunder that again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness; however, the sound guided him. He appeared to be unseen; for, though he called, the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \u201cAgain baffled!\u201d to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grooved by one whose strength seemed superhuman. Determined to sell his life dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain; he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground \u2013 his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his thigh \u2013 when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving\u2026\u201d rating through the hole, that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in moment the crash of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those who entered. The light of their torches fell upon the walls, and the thatch was loaded with every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey, they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries. He was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought him to a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was out a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side.\u201d his side. There was no color upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attached as the life that once dwelt there: upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: to this, the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A vampire! a vampire!\" A little was formed, and Audrey was laid by the side of who had lately been his object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had lived within her.

To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child\u2019s death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\u201d",
    "21": "Aubrey being possessed by a most violent fever, he was often delirious. In the intervals, he would appear before Lord Ruth Ven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unaccountable combination, he seemed to beg of his former companion to save the being he loved. At other times he would incant upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, at this time, arrived in Athens and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of Aubrey\u2019s state, immediately placed himself in the same house and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was frightened and startled at the sight of the image he had now come to see with that of a vampire\u2014but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implicitly implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. explanations.\n\n\u201cStill more by attention, anxiety, and care, he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence.

During the last stage of the invalid\u2019s recovery, Lord Ruthven was clearly engaged in watching the still waters raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the motionless fun; indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid her eyes.\u201d",
    "22": "Aubrey\u2019s mind, by this block, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lard Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighborhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins, his Ianthe form stood by his side\u2014if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the most delicate violet; then suddenly turning round, he would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded thigh.

They heard much of robbers, but gradually they slighted these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus reglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they traveled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as defense. Upon entering, however, a narrow gorge, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighboring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were.\u201d startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering bank of the defile; but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to resisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take hold in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they left the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground.
