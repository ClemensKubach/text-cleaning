    "3": "THEsuperstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it appears to be common: it did not extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a little Latin body could not be buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the helies existed, that vompyresnightly imbi6ed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumption; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and their veins became distended to such a state of completeness, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the orifices of their skins.",
    "4": "In the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious account of a particular case of vampirism, which is stated to have occurred at Madraga, in Hungary. It appears that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been accused to have said that, at Cassovia, the frontiers of the Turkish Servio, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre\u2019s grove, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in vampireism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, rosy, and ears, pure and flowing blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the bear and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out dreadfully as he had been olive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw him into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses of those persons who had previously died from varnpyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become clgent upan others who survived them.",

    "7": "This monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems bet weaker adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered a sort of punishment after doatb, for some heathen crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampirize, but compelled to confine bis infernal visions solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom be was bound by ties of kindness and affection.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"",
    "8": "But first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy cor\u017fe shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the natiue place, And suck thc blo0d of all thy race; There srom thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet l0atbe the banquet which perforee Must feed thy livid living cor\u017fe,Thy victims, ore they yet expirc, ShaIl know the demon for tbeir fire; As cvr\u017fing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowerf are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime musl fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart in flaine! Yel thou must end thy task and inark Her c heek's last tinge\u2014hor eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freozes o'er its lifeless b1ue; Then with unballowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock wheri sborn Affcction's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borne away by thee Memorial of lhine agony! Yet with thine own bost blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and baggard lip; Then sta1king to thy sullen gravc, Go\u2014arid with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till thefe in horror shrjnk away From spcctre more accursed than they.",
    "9": "Mr. Southey hcls also intraduced in his wild bul heavtiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vompyre corfe of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as havirig returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting hirn shc best loved whilst in exi\u017ftence.Bvt this cannot be supposed to havc resulted from the sinfulne\u017fs of her life, she being pourtrayed througbout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veraciou\u017f Tourncf0rt gives o long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrjsm, to which he pretends to have been ari eyewitness; and Calmet, iri his greot work upon this subject, besides avariety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of jts effects, has put forth \u017fome learned dissertalions, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian errar.",
    "10": "Many curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for a note, necearily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vrouco1ocha, Vardou1acba, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\n",

    "12": "IT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the variovs partles af lhe leaders of the ton anobleman, inore rcmarkable for his singularitjes, thcln his ran k. He gazed upon the mirth arourid him, as if he could not partielpate therein. Apporently, the light laughter of the fair orily attracted his attention, that he might by a loak quoll it, and throw fear into those breasts where th0ughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensalion of awe,could nat cxplajn whencc it arose: some attrihuted itt0 the dead grey eye, which, fixing upori the object's face, did nat seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the oheek with a leaden ray lhclt weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiclritios caused bim t0 be invited to every bou fe; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent exciteinent, and now felt the weight af en nui, were pleased at having somelhing in their preserice capable of engaging their attentian. In spite of the deadly hue 0f his foce, which neuor gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or srom the strong emotion of passiori, lhough its form and outline were beautiful, many of thc fcmale hunters after natoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gclin, ot leasl, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who bad been tbe mockery of euery monster shewn in drawing-rooms \u017fince her marriage, threw herse1f in his way, and did all but put an the dress of a mauntebank, to attract his not ice:\u2014thoughin vain:\u2014when fhe stood before him, though his eyes were apparonlly fixed upon her's, \u017ftill it seemed as lf they were unperceived;\u2014evcn her unappalled iinpudonce wels baffled, and she left the fiold. But though the comm0n adultress could not inflvence everi the guidancc of hi\u017f eyos, it was not that tbe female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was tho apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent davghter, that few knew hecver addressed himself to semaIos. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whelher it was that it even ouercarne the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as ofteri among those females who form the boast of thejr sex from their domestic virtues, as amang tho\u017fe who sully it by their vices.",
    "13": "Ahout the same time, there came a gentleman of the name of Aubrey to London, a orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it the duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary suballerns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that highromantic feelirig of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances; he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the wasting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter\u2019s eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in sine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, fair, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites; the daughter, at the same time, by their brightening countenance when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes when opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the ramance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from a lack of snuffing, there was no foundalion in recll life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from whence he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described crossed him in his career.",
    "14": "He watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that slattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became accustomed with him, paid him attentions, and so advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassing, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in \u2014 Street, that he was about to travel. Desired to gain some informalion respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the taur, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of uice towards permitting them to appear as if falling from the skies, whenever scandalous provocations were mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and forthwith immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthveri, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him.  Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling water.",
    "15": "Hitherto, Aubrey had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven\u2019s character, and now he found that though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was generous,\u2014the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the vicious, red-faced, reduced to idleness, that he beslowed his claims;\u2014these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the prodigal came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the vicious indigent. There was one circumstance about his Lordship\u2019s charity, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the failure, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centers of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his adversary, and then he lost even more than he gained. But it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around; it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckle\u017fs father of a number of families; then his very wish seemed fortune\u2019s law\u2014this apparent abstracledness of mind wels, laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat while dallying with the hal f-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the state that had drawn him within the friend; while many a father sat foritic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to feelisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruin of many, the last glimmer he had just snatched from the grasp of the innoence; this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of overcoming the unending of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tire to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthuen in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.",
    "16": "They soon arrived at Romc, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he promptly opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guards, the latter astonished him; if it had been stronger entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guards insisted upon his immediate departure from his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his vice, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation; in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.",
    "17": "Aubrey detcrmined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a sjngle bright point on which t0 rest tbe eye. He refolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watcb him more closely, ond to let no slight circurnslances pass by unnotlced. He entered into the \u017fame cir cle, and soon percoived, that his Lordship was ondeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldam that an unmarried female is met with in socjety; he was theref0re obliged to oarry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye fallowedhim in all his windingf, and soon diseoverod that an asflgnatlon had been appointed, whlch would mosl likely ond in tho ruin af an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entored the apartment 0f Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked hiin his intenlions wlth respect to the lady, informing himatel\u00e6 same time that be was aware of his being about to meet her thal uery night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his inlentions were such as he supposed clll would have upon such an occasion; and upon b eing pressed wbether he intended to marry her, laughcd. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that fram that moment he must declirie accompanyjnghis L0rdship in the remainder of tbeir proposed tour, he orderod his servarit to seek other apartments, and calling upon tho rnother of the lady, inf orined her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent hi\u017f scrvant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion ofhis plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.",
    "18": "```\nAubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek, and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records and ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaughtering them, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many colorful lichen. Under the same roof as herself, exclaimed a being so beautiful and delicate that she might have summoned the model for a prince wishing to portray on canvas the promised hope of Mahomet\u2019s paradise, saving that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain\u2019s side, one would have thought the gazelle was a poor typeof hers. For who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxuriously look of the animaI suited but to the taste of an epicure. Tbe light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kharmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, slowly fading as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyped upon an almost effaced ta6let, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Oflen would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibiting in the sun\u2019s ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mirid the very object he had before thought vital to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stiisling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memory for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colors of youthsul memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjectsthat had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the superriatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited even the interest of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living ampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest relatives, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely semalc to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such id1e and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names os oldrnen, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend\u2019s appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, so it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof giveri, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance os these monsters, and his horror was increased by hearing a pretty accurate description os Lord Rulhven; he, however, still persisted in pursuing her, that there could be a truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the marvelous coincidence which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthuen.\n```",
    "19": "Aubrey began to attoch himself more clnd more to Ianthe; her influence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sovght f0r bis visiori of romance, won his heart; and while he ridjculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more ottachod to lhe almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself ottimes fr0m her, and, forming a plan for sorne antiquarian reseclrch, he would depart, determined not to return until his object wos attained; but he always fourid it lmpofsible to fix his attention upori the rvins around him, whi1st in his mind he retained an irnoge that seemed aIone the rightful possessor of his tboughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank insantile being he had first known. She always seemed to pclrt from him with roluclarice; but it was becaufe she had rio longer any one with whom sbe could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some sragmenl which bad yet escapcd the destructive hand of time. Shc had appeaIed ta her parents on the subject of Vampyres, andthey both, with sevcr al prefent, affirmed their existence, pole with horror at the very name. Soori after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursion\u017f, which was to detain him sor a few hours; when they beard the name of the pla ce, thoy all at once be gged of him not to retvrn at night, as he must nocessarily pasf through a wood, where noGreek would ever remain, aster the day bad closed, vpon any con\u017fideration. They described it as the resart of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced lhe most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey rnade light of their representations, and tried to lavgh them out of lhe idea; bul when he saw them shudder at his darjng thus to mock a superiar, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he wos silent.",
    "20": "```\nNext morriing Aubrey set off upon his exoursian unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of bis host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those fiends, had inspired them with fuch terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly heged os him to returri, ere night allowed the power os these boirigs to be put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the wormer cllmates, so rapidly gathered into a tremendous mass, and paur aIl their rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, bowever, mounted his horse, determined to mako up by speed for his delay: hut it waf too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost vnknown; immediate1y tho sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the starm wclf above\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliago, whilst thc blue f0rked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at hi\u017f uery feet. Suddenly his horse toak srighl, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity througb the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, clnd he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was iri the neighbourhood of a bovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead lcaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouriting, he approachcd, hoping to find some one to guide him to the t0wn, or at lcast trusting to obtain sheltor from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the lhunders, for a moment silenl, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery os a laugh, contjnued iri one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced operi the door os the hut. He f0und himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guidedhim. He was apparently vnperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of bim. He found himself in c0n tacl with some one, whom he jmmediately \u017feized; when a uoice cried, \"Again baffled!\" t0 which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself groppled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his Iife cls dearly as he could, he struggled; but it wcls in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon hisbreast, had pIaced bis hands upon his thraat\u2014when thc glare of mony torches penetrating through the hole thclt gave light in the day, disturbod him;\u2014he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in cl momenl the crasbirig of the branches, as he broke throvgh the wood, was rio longer heard. Thc st0rm was now stiIl; and Aubrey, incapable os moving, was soon heard by those wilbout. They entered; tbe light of their torches fell upon the mvd wolls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; bvt what waf his horror, when the lighl of tbe torches once mare burst upon hiin, to perceive the airy form of hls fair conductress br0ught in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it wasut a visjon arisirig from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw tbe same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet th ere was a stillness abaut her foce that seemed almost as ottaching as the life that once dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simvltaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A lilter was quickly formed, and Au6rey waslaid by the side of her who had lately been to him thc objeot of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had dled within her. He knew nol whot his thoughts were\u2014his mirid was benumbed and seemcd to shun reflection, and take refvge in vacancy\u2014he held almost uriconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular constrvction, which had been found in thc hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engagedjn the search of ber wham a mother had missod. Their lamcntable cries, cls they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful cotastrophe. \u2014To describe their grlef would be impossible; but whenthey ascertained the cause 0f their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointcd to the corse. They were inconsolable; botb died br0ken-hearted.\n```",
    "21": "Aubrey being Pvt to bed was seized with a most vivid fever, and was often delirious; in the intervals he would easily upori Lord Ruthvcn and upon Ianthe\u2014hy some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destrier. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrized and startled at the sight of hlm whose image he had now come with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his klnd words, implied most nearly repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that an apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mirid, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon her\u2014with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile encouraged him. During the last stage of the invalid\u2019s recovery, Lord Ruthven was clearly engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless fun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyef of all.",
    "22": "aubrcy's mind, by this block, was much weokened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lard Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side\u2014if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the most violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded shoulder. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to whom recollection coveted to be attached: but though they thus had lened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but gradually began to slight the reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosely of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus regressing the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guises than as defense. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipies, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the choque report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile; but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting thoughts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they loft the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.",
    "23": "By promises of greal reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; arid having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence\u2014they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthuen's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may save me\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence a little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I cannot explain the whole\u2014but if you would conceal all your knowledge as mine, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth\u2014and if my death were unknown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes burst from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.",
    "24": "A retired man did not sleep, but many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man arose in his mind, and he knew not why. When he remembered his own thought, a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he held the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself or comrades, upon his own opinion, to the pinnaole of a neighboring mount, according to a promise they held given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and verify it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit, he heard no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the robbers.",
    "25": "Weary of a turmoil in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto or Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offense, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. While turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dogger discovered in the fatal sheath\u2014he shuddered, hoping to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed to gaze to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.",
    "26": "He left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Ro me, his fjrst inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and be had nat been heard of since lbe departuro of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almostbroken under so many repeated borrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victiin to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted jn urging lhe speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. Hc arrived at Calais; a breeze, which \u017feemed abedierit to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hostened to the mansiori of his fatbers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantinc caresses, had gainod his affection, now that the woman began to appear, sbe was still more attaching as a companion.",

Aubrey was there with his sister. While ho was standing in a corner by himself, beedless of all araund him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place\u2014he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized toowell, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceieved, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice ori this spot upon his first entry into so cicty.

    "29": "Au6rey became mostly distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engro\u017fsed, now that the certainty of the inonster\u2019s living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister\u2019s attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intricated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His aath startled him;\u2014was he then to allow this monster to roam, beclring ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose bif suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already inocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he few no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roomed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damp. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him downto rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distracted by him who fled from a pursuer brother than any\u2014from thought. His conduct, however, sudderly changed. Struck with the idea that he had left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter into society, and watch him clasely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, cl society which effected him so strongly. When, however, remon\u017ftrance proved victorious, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey\u2019s parents.\n",
    "30": "Desirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventirig him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hard1y appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherenee became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy luster\u2014the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then she sometimes started, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \u201cOh, do not touch him\u2014if your love for me is anything, do not go near him!\u201d When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \u201cTrue! true!\u201d and again he sank into a state, where not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the years were passing, his incoherenee became less frequent, and his mind broke off a portion of its gloom, while his guardians observed, that severl times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.",
    "31": "The lime had nearly elapscd, upon the lclst day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Avbrcy's being in so awfu1 a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. InstantlyAubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of whlch tbey feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking thif was a young Earl whom he had met with in sociely, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing bis iritontiori to be presenl at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sist er. They answered not, but in a few minutes his fister was with him. He was apparcntly again capable of being asfected by the influence of her lovely smiIe; for he pressed her tohis breast, and kissed her cheek, wot with tears, fl0wing at the thought of her brolher's bejng once more alive to tbe feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmlh, and to congratvlate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank arid euery accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprjse at beholding the features of the monster who had so long inf1uenced his life.

    "32": "Lord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. Where he heard of Aubrey\u2019s illness, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his affair, he gradually wore the ear of Miss Avery. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recover\u2014could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her love whom he addressed himself; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent\u2019s art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother\u2019s deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.",
    "33": "Aubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, proclaimed bribery the service; but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own brother, and the honor of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for how hours that marriage, on which she denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the names of busy preparations. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually withdrew, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the face, Lord Venner whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonored. Women are frail!\" So flying, he pushed him towards his allies, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage-ridden fingers were fraying, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.",

The beauty of this place, and the certainty of supply of cattle and vegetables always to 6e had there, induce many British vessels to visit it\u2014both men of war and merchants; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, we ourselves to0k a ramble to the cave called Homer\u2019s School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as over guide, who told us he held come from Scio with an English lord, who had left the islands for several days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.",

We were kindly recejved by an old man, who conducted us ouer the mansiori. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor\u2014an entrclnce hall, a drawing-room, a silting parlovr, and a6ed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, rnarble tablcs on ejther side, a large myrtle ln the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which couId be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in tbe side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the surniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairf, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, rior a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a largo mattress spread an the floor, with two stuffed cotlon quilts and a pillow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In tho sitling-ro0m we obscrved a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, fiIled with books and papers, which were then in a lclrge seaman's chest jn the closel: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contcnts. Ori the tablet os the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rausseau's works comp1ete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the Germari language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Mllton's Paradise Lost, an Italian editjon, printed at Parma in 1810; severa1 small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinoplc, much torn, hut no English book of any description.

I once did him a service, and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechin es which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"",

A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woads north of the Mournatian\u2019s base. The sea was smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminated the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty oaks and palm trees, several small islands were distinguished distinctly. I seldom enjoyed a view more than this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \u201cThe Armenians,\u201d said over the conductor, \u201ccould tell, but I am sure he will not,\u201d\u2014\u201cAnd cannot you tell, old friend?\u201d said I\u2014\u201cIf I could,\u201d said he, \u201cI dare not.\u201d We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learned several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fishermaker who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testament to the paor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. Ono circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cloase thought proper not to dissolve. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lard was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.",
