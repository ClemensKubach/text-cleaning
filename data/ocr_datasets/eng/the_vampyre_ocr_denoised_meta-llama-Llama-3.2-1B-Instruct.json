In the West, its spread, with slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the helices existed, that vomited nightly, imbeded a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumption; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and their veins became distended to such a state ofpletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the ulcer pores of their skins.",

It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been cursed to say, that, at Castovia, in the frontiers of the Turkish Servo, he had been tormented by a vampire, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grove, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; sor, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complainod of having been haunted by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (is supposed to be usual in cafes of vampirism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, rise, and ears, pure and foul blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out terribly as is he had been olive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corpses of those who had previously died from vampirism, lest they should, in their turn, become cursed up on others who survived them.",

He gazed upon the mirth arourid him, as if he could not partielpate therein. Apporently, the light laughter of the fair orily attracted his attention, that he might by a loak quoll it, and throw fear into those breasts where th0ughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensalion of awe,could nat cxplajn whencc it arose: some attrihuted itt0 the dead grey eye, which, fixing upori the object's face, did nat seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the oheek with a leaden ray lhclt weighed upon the skin it could not pass.

Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary soldiers, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that highromantic feelirig of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that virtue was thrown in by Providence merely for the pictvresque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage life consisted in the wasting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in his own mind, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving to describe him with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughter at the same time, by her brightening countenance when he approached, and by her sparkling eyes, when she opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions continued in those volumes from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relish his dreams, when the extraordinary behaviour that he had above described crossed him in his career.",

He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognized. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embroiled, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in \u2014 Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some informal knowledge of this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the task, which for many years had been too big a step for the youth to take, to become equal to the youth, and not allowing them to appear as if fleeing from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of pranks, according to the degree of skill shown in carrying them on. They consented; and Abrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circular waterf.",
    "15": "hitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of bis actians were exposed to his viow, the results offered different concluslons from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse ln his liberality;\u2014the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, reeeived from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediale wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, lhat it was not upon the virluous, redvced ta iridigence by the missortunes attendant even upon virtuc, thal he beslowed his cllms;\u2014these were sent from lhe door with hardly suppressed sneers; 6ut when thc profligate carne lo ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him lo wallow in hjs lust, or to sink him sti1l deeper in his iniquily, he was sent away with rich charity. This wos, howover, attributedby him to the greater importunity of tho vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virluous indigent. There was ono circumstance about the charity 0f his Lordship, which was stlll more lmpresfed up0n his mind: all lhose upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found thot therewas a curse vpon it, for they were all either led to the seaffaId, or sunk to the lowest and the most abjcct mjsery. At Brussels and othcr t owns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprizcd at the apparent eagerness with whieh his companion sought for the eentres of all fashionable vicc; there he entered jnto allthc spirit af the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, exoept where the known sharper was his aritagonist, and then he lost even more thari he gainod; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckle\u017fs fclther of a nurnerous family; then his very wish feamed fortune's law\u2014this apparent abstracledness of mind wcls Iaid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the hal f-dead mouse. In every town, he left tbe formerly affluenl youth, torn from the circle he adorncd, cur\u017fing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the sate that had drawn him within the reaeh os this fiend; wbilst many a father sat fraritic, clmidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immen\u017fe wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to fcltisfy thelr present craving. Yet ho took no money from thc gambling table; bvt immediatoly lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the conuulsive grasp of theinnooent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was riot, however, capable of ooinbatirig tbe eunning of the more exp-\nerienoed. Aubrey often wisbed to represent tbj\u017f to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of aAll, and dld not terid to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he h0ped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, tbis never occurrcd. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the samo: hi\u017f eye spoke less than his lip; and thougb Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtajned no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of voinly wishing to break tbat rny\u017ftery, which t0 his exalted imagination bcgan to assumo the appearance of something svpernalural.",

He entered into the \u017fame cir cle, and soon percoived, that his Lordship was ondeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldam that an unmarried female is met with in socjety; he was theref0re obliged to oarry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye fallowedhim in all his windingf, and soon diseoverod that an asflgnatlon had been appointed, whlch would mosl likely ond in tho ruin af an innocent, though thoughtless girl.

Lord Ruthven answered, that his inlentions were such as he supposed clll would have upon such an occasion; and upon b being pressed wbether he intended to marry her, merely laughcd.

The assignation was prevented.",
    "18": "Having lest Rome, Aubrey djrected his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the housc of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of anclent glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling thc deeds of freemen only before slaues, had hidden themsolves beneath the sheltering soil or many co1oured lichen. Under the same roof as hirnself, exlsted a being, so beautiful and delicate, thal she might have sormed the model for a pclinter wishing to pourtray on carivass tbe promised hope osthe saithful in Mahomet's parcldise, savothat her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls.

He would tear himself ottimes fr0m her, and, forming a plan for sorne antiquarian reseclrch, he would depart, determined not to return until his object wos attained; but he always fourid it lmpofsible to fix his attention upori the rvins around him, whi1st in his mind he retained an irnoge that seemed aIone the rightful possessor of his tboughts.

    "20": "Aubrey was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last stopped, and he found himself in a cold, dark hut. The sound of his own breathing guided him. He was apparently unconscious; for, though he called, still the sounds continued. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized. When a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" and a loud laugh succeeded, he felt himself being gripped by one whose strength seemed superhuman. Determined to sell his life dearly, he struggled, but it was in vain. He was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground. His enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, placed his hands upon his throat. The glare of many torches penetrating through the hole above disturbed him, and he instantly rose, and left his prey, rushed through the door, and burst through the branches of the wood. The storm was now still, and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those who were outside. They entered, and the light of their torches fell upon the mud-walls, and the straw thatch loaded on every individual. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for his missing woman, and when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, he perceived the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless corpse.",
    "21": "Aubrey being pvt to bed was seized with a most vialent fever, and was often delirjovs; inthe\u017fe intervals he would ea1l upori Lord Ruthvcn and upon Ianthe\u2014hy some unaccountable combination he seemed la beg of his former compclnion to sparo the being hc loved. At other times he would imprecote maledictionsupon his head, and curse him as her destrayer. L0rd Rutbven, chanced at this time to arrive al Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, andbecame his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrisjed and startled at the sight of hlm whose image he had now com6ined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his klnd words, iinplying cllnd repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care whichhe showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His 1ordship seemed quile changed; he na longer appeared that apathetic being who had \u017fo astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his eonvalescerice began to he rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mirid, and Aubrey perceiued no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon hirn, wilh a smi1e of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smilo hau-\nntcd him. During the last \u017ftage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was clppclrently engaged in watohing the tideless waves raised by the cooling brezzo, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, 1ike our world, the moveless fun;\u2014lndeed, he appeared to wish to av0id tbe eyef of all.",
    "22": "Aubrcy's mind, by this sbock, was much weokened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of \u017folitude and silence as Lard Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could nat find it in tbe neighbourhood of At hens; if he sought it amidsl the ruins hehad formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side\u2014if he sought it in tbe woods, her light step would appear wandering amldst the underwood, jn quest of the m0dest violet; then sudderily turning rond, would show, to hls wild imagination, her pale face and wounded lhroat, with a meek smile vpon her lips. Ho determined to fly scenes, every feature of which crcated such bitter associcltions in hif mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he heId himself bound hy the tender cclre he had taken af him during his illness, that tbey sbouId visit those parts of Greecc neilher had yet seen.",

Lord Ruthuen's \u017ftrengthrapidly deoreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advanoing with hasty steps. His coriduct and appeorance had not chonged; he seomed as unconscious of pain as he bad been of the objeets about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, andhis eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his asfistanoe with mare than usucll earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may save me\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed the death of my exj\u017ftence a\u017f liltle as that of the passirig day; but you may save my honour, your friend's hanour.\"\u2014\"How? lell me how?

    "24": "A ubrey retired to rest, but did not slcep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintioriee with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his ooth a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrl6le awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel iri which he held left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and his comrades, upon his retiring, lo the pineal of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose over his declth. Aubrey answered, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he sound no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identicol rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the cl0lhes.",
    "25": "Weary of a courilry in which he had met with \u017fuch terrible mjsfortunes, and iri which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melanchoIy that had seized upon his mind, he res olved l0 leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to canvey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he oceupied himsels in arranging those effects he had with him belongjng to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapled to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning tbem over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at fjnding a sheath apparently orriamented in tbo same style as the dogger di\u017fcovered in the fatal hvt\u2014he shuddcred\u2014ha\u017ftening to gain furtber proof, he found tho weapon, and his borror may be imagjned when he discovered that it fitted, though pocuIiarly shaped, the sheatb he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed ga2ing to be bound to lhe dagger; yct stilI he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon lhe haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for d oubt; there were also drops of blood on each.",
    "26": "He left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since their departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated borrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed abandoned to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hosteded to the manor of his father, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.",
    "27": "Miss Aubrey had riot that winning grclce which gains the gaze and appeal of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blive oye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm ab0ut it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feelirig within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was riot that light sooting, which strays whero'er a butterfly ora colour may attract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. When alorie, her face was never brightened by the smile of jay; but when her brother breathed to her his affect ion, and would in her presence forget lhase griefs she knew dostroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her fmile for that os the uoluptvary? It seemod as if those eyes,\u2014that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had nat been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her preseritation should 6e delayed untiI her brother's returri fromthe continent, when he might be hcr protector. It was now, therefore, resoIved thclt the next drawing-room, which was fastapproaching, should be the epoch of ber entry into the \"bu\u017fy scene.\" Aubrey would rather bave reinained in the mansion os his fathers, and fed up0n the ineIancboly which overpowered him. He could not feel interesl about the frlvolities of fashionable strongers, when bis mind had been so torri by the events he had witnessod; but he determined to sacrifice hls own comfort to the protectjon of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared f0r the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.",

If befare his mind had been ab\u017forbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engro\u017fsed, now that the certainty of the inonster's 1iving again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain thal she intrcated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt condu ct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, tbe more he was bewildered. His aath startled him;\u2014was he thcn to allow this monster to roam, beclring ruin upon his breath, ainidst all he held dear, and not avert its progrefs? His very sister mlght hclve been tauched by hlm. But euen if be were to break his oath, and disclose bif suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing bis own hand to free the world fram such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already inocked. For days ho remained in this state; shut up in his room,hc fow no one, and ate only when his \u017fister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stil1ness and solitude, he left his house, roomed from streot to stroet, anxious to fly that image whioh haunted hiin. His dress became neglected, arid he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to lhe midnight damps. He was no langer to 6e recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him downto rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safoly, employed people to follow him; butthey were soon distonced by him who fled from a pursuer switer than any\u2014from thought. His conduct, however, sudderily chariged. Struck with the idea thal ho left by his absence tho whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence tbey were unconscious, he determined to cnter agoin into society, and watcb bim clasely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when heentered into a room, hls haggard and suspicious looks were so st riking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstclin from seeking, for her sake, cl society which offected hlm so strongly. When, however, remon\u017ftrance proved vnavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust whjch had boen bofore imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.",
    "30": "Desirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardily appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy luster;\u2014the only sign of affliction and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the end of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands with looks that severely afflicted her, he would dire him not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him\u2014if your love for me is anything, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a state, whence he could not even be roused. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind, which had been so gloomy, began to lift.

Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of whlch tbey feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden.

Wheri he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause os it; but wheri he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. Ho hastoned to the house of his former companion, and, by coristant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his family, he gradually won the ear of Miss Avbrey.

The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the nates of the busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually slole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm hy force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my ride today, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So flying, he pushed him towards his alents, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his ragenat firing vent, had broken a blood vessel, and he was conveyed to bed.

    "44": "The view from this seat looks what may be called \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount CalIa, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majesty decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in brook cascades, until it was lost in the woods nother than the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty ochesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our inquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armeniari,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I could,\" sald he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. Ho had portioned eight young girls when he was last on the island, and oven danced with them at the nuptial feasl. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, ond cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to those poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the college thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lad was often seen walking on the sea shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.",

All the finer feolings of the heart, sa elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem lo have their seat in his bosom.
