Mitylene’s air, thick with the scent of salt and wild rosemary, washes away the echoes of London’s relentless clamor. I spend my days sketching the coastline, capturing the stark beauty of the cliffs and the restless sea. The solitude here is a rare and precious gift, a chance to reflect upon the triumphs and failures of a life spent chasing a fading dream. I’ve been sketching the Manor, a formidable structure of grey stone, reflecting the somber moods that often settle upon me. The servants are diligent, though their faces rarely hold a smile – a habit I’ve grown accustomed to, perhaps, to shield myself from the inevitable disappointment.  I find a strange comfort in the simplicity of the island’s existence, a stark contrast to the gilded cages I’ve known in the city.  I long for the warmth of your presence, Eleanor, and the quiet comfort of your embrace.  I pray for your health and happiness.\n\nYours eternally,\n\nLord Byron”",
