    "3": "The superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among tho Arabjans it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not endure if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the west it spread, with some slight variation, all over hungary, poland, austria, and lorraine, where the helies existed, that vompyresnightly imbi6ed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumption; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and their veins became distended to such a state of completion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the crux pores of their skins.",
    "4": "In the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampirism, which is stated to have occurred at Madryga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief arid magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certairi Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had bcen beclrd to say, that, at Cassovia, ori the fr0ntiers of the Turkish Servio, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the euj1, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grove, and rubbing him\u017felf with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; rather, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. lhabitants havjng consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (a\u017f is supposed to be usual in cafes of uampyrism) fresh, and entjrely free from corruptjon, and emitting at the mouth, riose, and ears, pure and fIorid blood. proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the bear and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out dreadfully as he had been olive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw asbestos into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the causes of those who had previously dicd from varnpyrism, lest they should, in theirturn, become clgentf upan others who survived them.",
    "5": "The universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampire becomes a vampire himself, arid sucks in turn.",

    "7": "rodomontade is here related, because it seems bet weaker adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other difference which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of pvnishment after doatb, for some hein ous crime commjtted whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but oompelled to confine bis infernal vjsitations solely to beings he loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom be was bound by ties of kindr od and affeclion.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"",
    "8": "Thy cor\u017fe shall from its tomb be rent; ghastly haunt the natiue place, And suck thc blo0d of all thy race; There srom thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet l0atbe the banquet which perforee Must feed thy livid living cor\u017fe,Thy victims, ore they yet expirc, ShaIl know the demon for tbeir fire; As cvr\u017fing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowerf are withered on the stem.

    "9": "Mr Southey hcls also intraduced in his wild bul heavtiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vompyre corfe of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as havirig returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting hirn shc best loved whilst in exi\u017ftence.Bvt this cannot be supposed to havc resulted from the sinfulne\u017fs of her life, she being pourtrayed througbout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracity of the tourncf0rt gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrjsm, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertalions, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian errar.",
    "10": "Many curious and intcresting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffiee for the limjts of a note, nece\u017fsarily devoted to explanation, and which inay now be conc1uded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are scvercll others synonymous withit, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vrouco1ocha, Vardou1acba, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.",

    "12": "It happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the variovs partles af lhe leaders of the ton anobleman, inore rcmarkable for his singularitjes, thcln his ran k. He gazed upon the mirth afar him, as if he could not participate therein. Apperently, the light laughter of the fair one attracted his attention, that he might by a loak quoll it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain when it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing up before the object\u2019s face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the other with a leaden ray light that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused bim t0 be invited to every bou fe; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent exciteinent, and now felt the weight af en nui, were pleased at having somelhing in their preserice capable of engaging their attentian. In spite of the deadly hue of his force, which neuron gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after nature attempted to win his attentions, and Glenn, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shown in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put an attempt at a maunkebank, to attract his notice:\u2014though in vain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unseen;\u2014even her unappeased indignation words baffled, and she left the field. But though commonly adultress could not inflvence everi the guidancc of hi\u017f eyos, it was not that tbe female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was tho apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent davghter, that few knew hecver addressed himself to semaIos. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even aroused the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often as not among those females who form the boast of their own sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.",
    "13": "Ahout the \u017fame time, there cclme to Lond0n a yourig gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died whlle he was yet jn childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it be their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary suballerns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that highromantic feelirig of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathize with virtue, and thought that vico was thrown in by providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the stitching of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter\u2019s eye by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, jn sine, that the dreams os poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frarik, and rieh: for lhese reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers svrrounded bim,striving which shovld describe wlth least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daug-\nher\u017f at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, whenbo opened his lips, s0on led him into false notions of his talenls and his merit. he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax cclndles that flickered, not from the presencc of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundalion in recll life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions coritained in those volumes, from whjch he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in being satisfied, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.",
    "14": "He watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of ifferior observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that seemed to have a propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquired with him, paid him after, and so advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognized. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven\u2019s affairs were embarrassing, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in \u2014 Street, that he was about to travel. desirous of gaining some informalion respeeling this sirigular character, who, till now, had orily whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians that it was time for him to perform the taur, which for many gerierations has been thought to be necessary to enable young to take some rapid steps in the career of use towards putting themselves upon an equality with the old, and not allowing them to appear as if falling from the skies, whenever scaridalovs intrigues were mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, accordingly to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Avbrey immediately mentioning bis intentions to Lord Ruthveri, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Fla mottled by such a mark of estcem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling water.",
    "15": "Hitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven\u2019s character, and now he found, that though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his generosity; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virulent, redvced ta iridigence by the missortunes attendant even upon virtuc, that he beslowed his cllms; these were sent from lhe door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the prostitute carne lo ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him lo wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquily, he was sent away with rich charity. This word, howover, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the vicious indigent. There was a circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressive up on his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the downfall, or sunk to the lowest and most atrocious misery. At Brussels and othcr t owns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprizcd at the apparent eagerness with whieh his companion sought for the eentres of all fashionable vicc; there he entered jnto allthc spirit af the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, exoept where the known sharper was his aritagonist, and then he lost even more thari he gainod; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so wben he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckle\u017fs fclther of a nurnerous family; then his very wish feemed fortune's law\u2014this apparent abstracledness of mind wcls Iaid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the hal f-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the state that had drawn him within the reach of this friend; while many a father sat far from, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to feel satisfy their present craving. Yet ho took no money from thc gambling table; bvt immediatoly lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the conuent of theinnooent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was riot, however, capable of ooinbatirig tbe eunning of the more exp- Aubrey often wished to represent tbj\u017f to his friend, and begged him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tire to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthuen in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: hi\u017f eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of wondering to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.",
    "16": "The soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, while he went to search for the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he wa thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he uponponed with eager impatience; the first wos from his sister, breathing nothirig but affection; lhe others were from his gvardians, the latter astanished him; if it had hesore entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these soemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediate departure from his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but thought he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his vjclim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of sullicence, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.",
    "17": "Aubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He refolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watcb him more closely, ond to let no slight circurnslances pass by unnotlced. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his lordship was endeavoring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is sad that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to marry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey\u2019s eye followed him in all his winding paths, and soon discovered that an assignment had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed would be upon such an occasion, and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say that fram that moment he must declaire accompanyjnghis L0rdship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his service to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. assignment prevented Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his history servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey\u2019s intervention.",
    "18": "Having let Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaughtering, had hidden themself below the sheltering soil or many colored lichen. Under the same roof as hirnself, exclaimed a being, so beautiful and delicate that she might have summoned a preacher wishing to portray on the promise of hope, saying that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain\u2019s side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor typeof crawler becluties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature for that sleepy luxurlous look of the animaI suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a kammerer's butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, shimmering as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just deciphered upori an almost erased tapestry. Oflen would her tresses falIing, as she flitted around, exhibit in the s un's ray such delica tely brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antjquary, who lel escape from his mirid the very objecl he had before thaughl of vital importance to the proper interpretation os a passage in Pausanias. Why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stisling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memory for hls future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subject that had evidentIy made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her engine, and apparent belief of what she narratod, excited interest even of Aubrey; and oftenas she told him the tale of the living uampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest tles, forced every year, by feeding upon a lovely semalc to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst be attempted to laugh her out of such id1e and horrible fantasles; but Ianthe citedto him the riames os oldrnen, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children hod been found marked with lhe stamp of the fiend\u2019s appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to bclieve her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, alway\u017f had some proof giveri, which obljged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to con fess it was trve.She detailed to him the traditional appearance os these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hoaring a pretty accurate description os Lord Rulhven; he, however, still persisted in persuclding her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same tirne he wondcred at the mariy coiricidencos which had all tended to excjte a belief in tho supernatural power of Lord Ruthuen.",
    "19": "Aubrey began to attoch himself more clnd more to Ianthe; her innoeence, so contrasted with all the affccted virtues of the women among whom he had sovght f0r bis visiori of romance, won his heart; and whlle he ridjculed the idca of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found hiinself m0re and more ottachod to lhe almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself oftimes from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always felt it was imperfectly possible to fix his attention upori the rivers around him, while in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank insantile being he had first known. She always seemed to speak with clarity; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some secrets that had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. Sch had appeared to her parents on the subject of Vampires, and they both, with several preventing, affirmed their existence, pole with horror at the very name. Soori after Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they beard the name of the place, they all at once be questioned of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, upon the consideration. The resart of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced lhe most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey ran made light of their representations, and tried to leave them out of her idea; but when he saw them shudder at his regard thus to mock a superiar, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.",
    "20": "Next morring aubrey set off upon his exoursian unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of bis host, and was concerned to sind lhat his words, mocking the belief of those horri6le fiends, had lnspired them with fuch terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly he grieved os him to return. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gathered into a tremendous mass, and paur all their rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the starm wolf above\u2014its echoing thunder had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse toppled straight, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped; it found, 6y the glare of lightning, that it was in the neighborhood of a boulder that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. dismouring, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the hundreds, for a moment still, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled, but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door to the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unnoticed; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in con tacl with someone, whom he imediately seized; when a uoice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself groppled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life cls dearly as he could, he struggled; but it wcls in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon hisbreast, had placed bis hands upon his thigh\u2014when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;\u2014he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in moment the crash of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those about. The light of their torches fell upon the mosses, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; bvt what waf his horror, when the light of the torches once burst upon his eyes, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless corpse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was 6ut a visjon arisirig from hls disturbed imagination; but he again saw tbe same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her force that seemed almost as attached as the life that once dwelt there: upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A vampire! a vampire!\" A little was formed, and Audrey was laid by the side of the who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew nothing what his thoughts were\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of ber wham a mother had missod. Their lamented cries, they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child\u2019s death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; botb died broken-hearted.",
    "21": "Aubrey being Pvt to bed was seized with a most vialent fever, and was often delirious; in the these intervals he would easily upori Lord Ruthvcn and upon Ianthe\u2014hy some unaccountable combination he seemed la beg of his former compclnion to sparo the being hc loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Rutbven, changed at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. \u201cWhen the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of hlm whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kindly words, implied nearly repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence.\u201d His leadership seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared as an apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his epochal returns began to occur, he again gradually retired into the same state of mirid, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon her, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smiled haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid\u2019s recovery, Lord Ruthven was clearly engaged in watching the still waters raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moving things;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.",
    "22": "Aubry\u2019s mind, by this block, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lard Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthe\u2019s form stood by his side\u2014if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the most remote violet; then suddenly turning around, he would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded thigh. ho determined to fly scenes, every feature of which crcated such bitter associcltions in hif mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he was bound by the tender care he had taken him himself during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which recollection covId be attached, but though they thus have lened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. Tbcy heard much of robbers, but they gradually begari to slight thesc reports, which they jmagined were only the invention of individvals, whosc interest it was to excite the generosily of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence af thus rieglceting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasiori they travellcd with only a few guards, more to serve as guldes than as a defence. Upon entering, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighboring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcly were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the shot report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, peacefully themselves behind rocks, hadgun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthucn and Aubrey, imitating their exarnple, retired for a moment behjnd the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting fhouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the r0bbers should climb above and take lhom in the rear, they determlned at once to rush forward jn search of the enemy. Hardly had they loft the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the grourid. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers\u2019 faces around him\u2014bis guards having, upon Lord Ruthven\u2019s being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.",

Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. there were several daggers and ataghans.

It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her preservation should be delayed until her brother\u2019s return from the continent, when he might be her protector. it was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fastapproaching, should be the epoch of ber entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion as his father, and fed up on the interior decorator which overpowered him.

The beauty of this place, and the certcliri supply of cattle and vegetables always had there, induced many British vessels to visit it \u2013 both men of war and merchants. Though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the thick bay, and while the men were employed in watering, and the captain bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and I myself took a walk to the cave called Homer\u2019s School and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida, we met with and engaged a young Greek, who told us he believed he came from Scio with an English lord, who led the islarid sorrows before our arrival in his felucca. He engaged me as a pilot, the Greek, and would have taken me with him, but I did not choose to quit Mollyrene, where I am likely to get married. He was a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to Himm, and he has left an old mcln in cbclrge of it: ho gave Dominick, the wlne-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has reslded there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sa ils in his felucca very often to the differont is1ands.",

They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, raspberry tables on either side, a large myrtle in the center, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the room. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairf, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, rior a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a largo mattress spread an the floor, with two stuffed cotlon quilts and a pillow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman\u2019s chest in the cellar: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. Ori the tablet os the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rausseau's works comp1ete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the Germari language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Mllton's Paradise Lost, an Italian editjon, printed at Parma in 1810; severa1 small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinoplc, much torn, hut no English book of any description.

I seldom enjoyed a visit more than this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenians,\" said over conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on over return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord.\" ho portioned eight young girlswhen he was la\u017ft vpon tbe lsland, and oven danced with them at the nuptial feasl.

I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship\u2019s good reputation, which has been grossly slandered. He has been descibed as of an unfeeling disposition, avrse to associatjng with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its forces, or add lo its pleasures. The fact is directly, o's may be plentifully gathered from these little anecdotes. all the feelings of the heart, sweetly depicted in his lordship\u2019s poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. tenderness sympathy charity guides his actions and his courting of repose is an additional reason to mark him as a being on whose heart religion bath set, and over whose head benevolence hath thrown her inontle. Please provide the noisy text. I need the text to be able to denoise it. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be cautioned, particularly when directed against man\u2019s moral integrity, and be who dares justify themselves before that awful tribunal where all must appear, counsel may censure the errors as a fellow mortal.
