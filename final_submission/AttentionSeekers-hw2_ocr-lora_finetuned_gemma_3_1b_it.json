    "3": "The superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not be buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the helzys existed, that vompy night disease afflicted a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumption; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and their veins became distended to such a state of perfection, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the curtilings of their skins.",
    "4": "In the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious and credible account of a particular case of vampirism, which is stated to have occurred at Madraga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commanders-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been believed to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servile, he had been tormented by a vampire, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grove, and rubbing himself with his blood. This account, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; nor, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cafes of impurities) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and fioured blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the ears and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out dreadfully as is he had been lately. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the causes of those persons who had previously discarded from var}^pyrism, lest they should, in turn, become contemptible upon others who survived them.",
    "5": "The universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampire becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.",
    "6": "Chlef baiiff.",
    "7": "This monstrous rodontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vapours, but compelled to confine his infernal visits solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom he was bound by ties of kindness and affection.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"",
    "8": "But first on earth, as Vampyre sent, thy curse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet let be the banquet which perpetuates, Must feed thy livid living corpse, Thy victims, ore they yet expire, They shall know the demon for their fire; As conversing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flower are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unbowed hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock whither Affection's fondest pledge was worn\u2014But now is borne away by the Memorial of her agony! Yet with thine own blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and garden lips; Then standing to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and with Gulps and Farts rave, Till thefe in horror shriek away from spectre more accursed than they.",
    "9": "Mr. She has also introduced in his wild ballad a beautiful poem of \"Thalab,\" the vomitor of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting her shiest loved one whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being portrayed throughout the whole tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The various tournings of the earth gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampirism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.",
    "10": "Many curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vulpidae, Vardouacaba, Goul, Broucoloka, etc.",
    "11": "THE VAMPIRE.",
    "12": "I happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parts of the ton anobleman, more remarkable for his singular traits, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not partake therein. Appreciatively, the light laughter of the fair maiden attracted his attention, that he might by a look quoll it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe could not explain when it arose: some attribute it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that left weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarity caused him to be invited to every bouff\u00e9e; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of a nuisance, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his force, which neither gained a warmer tint, nor from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after nature attempted to win his attentions, and gained little less than some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put an attire of a mountainebank, to attract his notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when she stood before him, though his eyes were almost fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unseen;\u2014even her unappalled impatience was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common address could not influence every idea of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to semas. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.",
    "13": "About the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died whilst he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary schemes, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, the high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the wasting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in silence, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, fair, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughter at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the ramp of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in recollection for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in bis gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.",
    "14": "He watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that slattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the garb of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the persons before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in \u2014 Street, that he was about to travel. Desired of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the trial, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable him to take some rapid steps in the career of justice towards putting himself upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallier from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthver, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Faltered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling water.",
    "15": "Hitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his generosity;\u2014the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virulent, redressed irresponsibility by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his claims;\u2014these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the prodigal came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquities, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the vicious indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more imprinted upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the aid, or sunk to the lowest and most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the fashionable: he bettered, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the unfortunate father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law\u2014this apparent abstracelessness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adored, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the state that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; while many a father sat for fictitious, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, where with to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruin of many, the last glazier he had just snatched from the cruel grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of overcoming the unyielding of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent himself to his friend, and begged him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tire to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthuen in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of wondering to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.",
    "16": "They soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had he sooner entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediate departure from his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the daughtress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that her accomplice, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had since his departure thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.",
    "17": "Aubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the meanwhile, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is so seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; she was therefore obliged to carry on her plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his winding course, and soon discovered that an appointment had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless, girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must declare accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servants to seek other apartments, and calling upon the other of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assassination was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.",
    "18": "Having lost last Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as herself, excited a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to portray the promised hope of the saints in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor typeof her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Chimera butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just deciphered up a nearly erased slate, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Of often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicate brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stylish balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memory for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subject that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampire, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest relatives, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely mammal to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idles and horrible fancies; but I then cited him the grim olden, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof giveri, which obligged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Rulven; he, however, still persisted in pursuing her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the myriad coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Rulven.",
    "19": "Aubrey began to atch himself more closely and more to Ianne; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had so long sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself often from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the river around him, while in his mind he retained an idea that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank and innocent being he had first known. She always seemed to perplex from him with clarity; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some sensationalism which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appeared to her parents on the subject of Vampires, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soorre after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the start of the vampires in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to lav them out of his idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.",
    "20": "My morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to see that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiend, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly heged on him to return, ere night allowed the power of these birds to be put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those spots which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and part upon all their rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the star well above\u2014its echoing thunder had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopy of foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took straight, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a bovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the hundreds, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery as a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door as the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unseen; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a noise cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself gropped by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat\u2014when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;\u2014he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those who were without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mounds of weeds, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless curse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was a vision arisen from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lips; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A little was formed, and Audrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her husband. Their lamentable cries, alas, they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the cross. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.",
    "21": "Aubrey being private to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would lay upon Lord Ruthven and upon the young man\u2014by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would invoke maledictions upon his head, and curse him as his destroyer. Lord Rutbert, changed at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now come with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, in plainly implying a clime of repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathy being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his consecillatorice began to he rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mirth, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile aroused During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling like our world, the motionless fun; indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.",
    "22": "Aubrey's mind, by this book, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Anthes; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, his form stood by his side\u2014if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amongst the underwood, in quest of the most delicate violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he had himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which recollection could be attached: but though they thus had lened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight the reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus regarding the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the shot heard of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthwell and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting thoughts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they loft the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.",
    "23": "By promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence\u2014they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthuen's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may save me\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how?

breathed no more.",
    "24": "A dreary retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man arose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his thoughts a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a docker met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself or his comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey affrighted, and taking several of the men, determined to go by and verify it upon the spot where it lay. But when he had mounted to the summit, he could not trace the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the cloases.",
    "25": "Weary of a cruel conspiracy in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to carry him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dogger discovered in the fatal heart\u2014he shook\u2014hesitant to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.",
    "26": "He left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of her lord. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated errors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen into the victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became more morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed barely to tire him, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he listened to the manners of his father, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her innocent caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.",
    "27": "Miss Aubrey had rarely won any great grief which gained the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that brilliant light which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her love eyes were never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light sooting, which stares where ever a butterfly or colour may attract\u2014it was sedentary and pensive. When Allie, her face was never brightened by the smile of Jay; but when her brother breathed to her his affect ion, and would in her presence forget his griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that os the oblivion? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her preservation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion as his fathers, and fed up on the indolence which overpowered him. He could not feel interest in the frivolousities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so troubled by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.",
    "28": "The crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were clenchant to bask in the smiles of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, barely aware of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place\u2014he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He went on his limb almost resigning to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014circumstances started up in dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath\u2014he roused himself, he could hardly believe it possible\u2014the dead rose again!\u2014He thought his imagination had conjured up the image of his mir-\nid was rest-irig upon. It was impossible that it could be real\u2014he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hurried upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several apparently in earnest conversations; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forked her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper \"Remember your oath!\" He did not dart to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.",
    "29": "Audrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she interrogated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His heart startled him;\u2014was he then to allow this monster to roam, besmirching ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already stricken. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, for no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roomed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he lay down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distracted by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any\u2014from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly charged. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and to watch him closely, anxious to warn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, such society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstration proved vain, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.",
    "30": "Desirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;\u2014the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he sometimes started, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him\u2014if your love for me is aught, do not go nearer him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a state, in which even she could not rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind began to break off a portion of its gloom, while his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.",
    "31": "The lime had nearly elapsed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Avery's being in such a awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously who. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his irritation to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his father was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, which with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future bride, he looked as if he did not understand her\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a sarcastic expression of compliance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he\u2014But he could not advance\u2014it seemed as if that voice again bade her remember his oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthuen was near him but saw no one. I in the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this word but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubery, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attracting this to the sanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.",
    "32": "Lord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's illness, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by consistent attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his tale, he gradually wore the ear of Miss. Avery. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recover\u2014could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being in the crowded earth, save with her whom he addressed himself;\u2014could tell how, since he knew her, his existence had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder ranch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.",
    "33": "Aubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own brother, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which she condemned the most heavy curses. The seconds promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the ants on busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ears. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually slowed away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the face case, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my ride at day, your sister is dishonoured.\" Women are frail! So flying, he pushed him towards his assistants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could not tolerate himself; his raging finding vent, had broken a blood- vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.",
    "34": "Aubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader had perused\u2014he died immediately after.",
    "35": "The guards hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPIRE!",

    "37": "ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.",
    "38": "\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"",
    "39": "IN sailing through the Greek Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mykonos, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certainty of supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induced many British vessels to visit it\u2014both men of war and merchants; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who last saw the iridors sour days previous to our arrival in his feluca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Milione, where I am likely to get married.\" He was odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominic, the weaver-trader, six hundred zeches for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his feluca very often to the different islands.",
    "40": "This account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our country man had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us out of the manor. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting-room, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, rather drab tables on either side, a large marble in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the supper. In the hall stood half a dozen English chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a largo mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seamen's chest in the cell: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. Our the tablet is the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Voltaire's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the Germane language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of those books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.",
    "41": "The old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to remove one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; else he others way very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zeches which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought me from Adrianople; I do not know for what reason.",
    "42": "The appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifteen paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roos. The roof, surrounded by a light slanting balustrade, was covered by a fine timber layer, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the houses are furnished, and upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.",
    "43": "On the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges, and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed merry of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"",
    "44": "The view from this seat reveals what may be termed a bird's-eye view. A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calca, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majesty decay. A few streams issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods at the mountain's base. The sea was smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminated the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty hopesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studdying the light of the blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenians,\" said the conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And can you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can, I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenians, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testament to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to lose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lad was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.",
    "45": "Such was the information with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mytilene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Failing in company with Mr. Foster, the architect, a pupil of Wyatt's, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"the individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and also visited him at Mytilene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we bad been some years from home; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into our hands, we recognised the recluse of Clerval in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we cordially agreed to return to Mytilene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lord's humble title, which has been grossly scandalised. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to soothe its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse of what may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, as elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religions bath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her inontile. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, shall censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.",
