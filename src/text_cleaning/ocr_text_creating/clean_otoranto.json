  "0": "\n\nHORACE WALPOLE was the youngest son of Sir Robert Walpole, the great\nstatesman, who died Earl of Orford. He was born in 1717, the year in\nwhich his father resigned office, remaining in opposition for almost\nthree years before his return to a long tenure of power. Horace Walpole\nwas educated at Eton, where he formed a school friendship with Thomas\nGray, who was but a few months older. In 1739 Gray was\ntravelling-companion with Walpole in France and Italy until they differed\nand parted; but the friendship was afterwards renewed, and remained firm\nto the end. Horace Walpole went from Eton to King\u2019s College, Cambridge,\nand entered Parliament in 1741, the year before his father\u2019s final\nresignation and acceptance of an earldom. His way of life was made easy\nto him. As Usher of the Exchequer, Comptroller of the Pipe, and Clerk of\nthe Estreats in the Exchequer, he received nearly two thousand a year for\ndoing nothing, lived with his father, and amused himself.\n\nHorace Walpole idled, and amused himself with the small life of the\nfashionable world to which he was proud of belonging, though he had a\nquick eye for its vanities. He had social wit, and liked to put it to\nsmall uses. But he was not an empty idler, and there were seasons when\nhe could become a sharp judge of himself. \u201cI am sensible,\u201d he wrote to\nhis most intimate friend, \u201cI am sensible of having more follies and\nweaknesses and fewer real good qualities than most men. I sometimes\nreflect on this, though, I own, too seldom. I always want to begin\nacting like a man, and a sensible one, which I think I might be if I\nwould.\u201d He had deep home affections, and, under many polite\naffectations, plenty of good sense.\n\nHorace Walpole\u2019s father died in 1745.",
  "1": " The eldest son, who succeeded to\nthe earldom, died in 1751, and left a son, George, who was for a time\ninsane, and lived until 1791. As George left no child, the title and\nestates passed to Horace Walpole, then seventy-four years old, and the\nonly uncle who survived. Horace Walpole thus became Earl of Orford,\nduring the last six years of his life. As to the title, he said that he\nfelt himself being called names in his old age. He died unmarried, in\nthe year 1797, at the age of eighty.\n\nHe had turned his house at Strawberry Hill, by the Thames, near\nTwickenham, into a Gothic villa\u2014eighteenth-century Gothic\u2014and amused\nhimself by spending freely upon its adornment with such things as were\nthen fashionable as objects of taste. But he delighted also in his\nflowers and his trellises of roses, and the quiet Thames. When confined\nby gout to his London house in Arlington Street, flowers from Strawberry\nHill and a bird were necessary consolations. He set up also at\nStrawberry Hill a private printing press, at which he printed his friend\nGray\u2019s poems, also in 1758 his own \u201cCatalogue of the Royal and Noble\nAuthors of England,\u201d and five volumes of \u201cAnecdotes of Painting in\nEngland,\u201d between 1762 and 1771.\n\nHorace Walpole produced _The Castle of Otranto_ in 1765, at the mature\nage of forty-eight. It was suggested by a dream from which he said he\nwaked one morning, and of which \u201call I could recover was, that I had\nthought myself in an ancient castle (a very natural dream for a head like\nmine, filled with Gothic story), and that on the uppermost banister of a\ngreat staircase I saw a gigantic hand in armour.",
  "2": " In the evening I sat\ndown and began to write, without knowing in the least what I intended to\nsay or relate.\u201d So began the tale which professed to be translated by\n\u201cWilliam Marshal, gentleman, from the Italian of Onuphro Muralto, canon\nof the Church of St. Nicholas, at Otranto.\u201d It was written in two\nmonths. Walpole\u2019s friend Gray reported to him that at Cambridge the book\nmade \u201csome of them cry a little, and all in general afraid to go to bed\no\u2019 nights.\u201d _The Castle of Otranto_ was, in its own way, an early sign\nof the reaction towards romance in the latter part of the last century.\nThis gives it interest. But it has had many followers, and the hardy\nmodern reader, when he reads Gray\u2019s note from Cambridge, needs to be\nreminded of its date.\n\n H. M.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.\n\n\nThe following work was found in the library of an ancient Catholic family\nin the north of England. It was printed at Naples, in the black letter,\nin the year 1529. How much sooner it was written does not appear. The\nprincipal incidents are such as were believed in the darkest ages of\nChristianity; but the language and conduct have nothing that savours of\nbarbarism. The style is the purest Italian.\n\nIf the story was written near the time when it is supposed to have\nhappened, it must have been between 1095, the era of the first Crusade,\nand 1243, the date of the last, or not long afterwards. There is no\nother circumstance in the work that can lead us to guess at the period in\nwhich the scene is laid: the names of the actors are evidently\nfictitious, and probably disguised on purpose: yet the Spanish names of\nthe domestics seem to indicate that this work was not composed until the\nestablishment of the Arragonian Kings in Naples had made Spanish\nappellations familiar in that country.",
  "3": " The beauty of the diction, and\nthe zeal of the author (moderated, however, by singular judgment) concur\nto make me think that the date of the composition was little antecedent\nto that of the impression. Letters were then in their most flourishing\nstate in Italy, and contributed to dispel the empire of superstition, at\nthat time so forcibly attacked by the reformers. It is not unlikely that\nan artful priest might endeavour to turn their own arms on the\ninnovators, and might avail himself of his abilities as an author to\nconfirm the populace in their ancient errors and superstitions. If this\nwas his view, he has certainly acted with signal address. Such a work as\nthe following would enslave a hundred vulgar minds beyond half the books\nof controversy that have been written from the days of Luther to the\npresent hour.\n\nThis solution of the author\u2019s motives is, however, offered as a mere\nconjecture. Whatever his views were, or whatever effects the execution\nof them might have, his work can only be laid before the public at\npresent as a matter of entertainment.",
  "4": " Even as such, some apology for it\nis necessary. Miracles, visions, necromancy, dreams, and other\npreternatural events, are exploded now even from romances. That was not\nthe case when our author wrote; much less when the story itself is\nsupposed to have happened. Belief in every kind of prodigy was so\nestablished in those dark ages, that an author would not be faithful to\nthe manners of the times, who should omit all mention of them. He is not\nbound to believe them himself, but he must represent his actors as\nbelieving them.\n\nIf this air of the miraculous is excused, the reader will find nothing\nelse unworthy of his perusal. Allow the possibility of the facts, and\nall the actors comport themselves as persons would do in their situation.\nThere is no bombast, no similes, flowers, digressions, or unnecessary\ndescriptions. Everything tends directly to the catastrophe. Never is\nthe reader\u2019s attention relaxed. The rules of the drama are almost\nobserved throughout the conduct of the piece. The characters are well\ndrawn, and still better maintained. Terror, the author\u2019s principal\nengine, prevents the story from ever languishing; and it is so often\ncontrasted by pity, that the mind is kept up in a constant vicissitude of\ninteresting passions.",
  "5": "\n\nSome persons may perhaps think the characters of the domestics too little\nserious for the general cast of the story; but besides their opposition\nto the principal personages, the art of the author is very observable in\nhis conduct of the subalterns. They discover many passages essential to\nthe story, which could not be well brought to light but by their\n_na\u00efvet\u00e9_ and simplicity. In particular, the womanish terror and foibles\nof Bianca, in the last chapter, conduce essentially towards advancing the\ncatastrophe.\n\nIt is natural for a translator to be prejudiced in favour of his adopted\nwork. More impartial readers may not be so much struck with the beauties\nof this piece as I was. Yet I am not blind to my author\u2019s defects. I\ncould wish he had grounded his plan on a more useful moral than this:\nthat \u201cthe sins of fathers are visited on their children to the third and\nfourth generation.\u201d I doubt whether, in his time, any more than at\npresent, ambition curbed its appetite of dominion from the dread of so\nremote a punishment. And yet this moral is weakened by that less direct\ninsinuation, that even such anathema may be diverted by devotion to St.\nNicholas. Here the interest of the Monk plainly gets the better of the\njudgment of the author. However, with all its faults, I have no doubt\nbut the English reader will be pleased with a sight of this performance.",
  "6": "\nThe piety that reigns throughout, the lessons of virtue that are\ninculcated, and the rigid purity of the sentiments, exempt this work from\nthe censure to which romances are but too liable. Should it meet with\nthe success I hope for, I may be encouraged to reprint the original\nItalian, though it will tend to depreciate my own labour. Our language\nfalls far short of the charms of the Italian, both for variety and\nharmony. The latter is peculiarly excellent for simple narrative. It is\ndifficult in English to relate without falling too low or rising too\nhigh; a fault obviously occasioned by the little care taken to speak pure\nlanguage in common conversation. Every Italian or Frenchman of any rank\npiques himself on speaking his own tongue correctly and with choice. I\ncannot flatter myself with having done justice to my author in this\nrespect: his style is as elegant as his conduct of the passions is\nmasterly. It is a pity that he did not apply his talents to what they\nwere evidently proper for\u2014the theatre.\n\nI will detain the reader no longer, but to make one short remark. Though\nthe machinery is invention, and the names of the actors imaginary, I\ncannot but believe that the groundwork of the story is founded on truth.\nThe scene is undoubtedly laid in some real castle. The author seems\nfrequently, without design, to describe particular parts.",

If a catastrophe, at all resembling that which he\ndescribes, is believed to have given rise to this work, it will\ncontribute to interest the reader, and will make the \u201cCastle of Otranto\u201d\na still more moving story.\n\n\n\n\nSONNET TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LADY MARY COKE.\n\n\n The gentle maid, whose hapless tale\n   These melancholy pages speak;\n Say, gracious lady, shall she fail\n   To draw the tear adown thy cheek?\n\n No; never was thy pitying breast\n   Insensible to human woes;\n Tender, tho\u2019 firm, it melts distrest\n   For weaknesses it never knows.\n\n Oh! guard the marvels I relate\n Of fell ambition scourg\u2019d by fate,\n   From reason\u2019s peevish blame.\n Blest with thy smile, my dauntless sail\n I dare expand to Fancy\u2019s gale,\n   For sure thy smiles are Fame.\n\n H. W.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nManfred, Prince of Otranto, had one son and one daughter: the latter, a\nmost beautiful virgin, aged eighteen, was called Matilda. Conrad, the\nson, was three years younger, a homely youth, sickly, and of no promising\ndisposition; yet he was the darling of his father, who never showed any\nsymptoms of affection to Matilda. Manfred had contracted a marriage for\nhis son with the Marquis of Vicenza\u2019s daughter, Isabella; and she had\nalready been delivered by her guardians into the hands of Manfred, that\nhe might celebrate the wedding as soon as Conrad\u2019s infirm state of health\nwould permit.",
  "8": "\n\nManfred\u2019s impatience for this ceremonial was remarked by his family and\nneighbours. The former, indeed, apprehending the severity of their\nPrince\u2019s disposition, did not dare to utter their surmises on this\nprecipitation. Hippolita, his wife, an amiable lady, did sometimes\nventure to represent the danger of marrying their only son so early,\nconsidering his great youth, and greater infirmities; but she never\nreceived any other answer than reflections on her own sterility, who had\ngiven him but one heir. His tenants and subjects were less cautious in\ntheir discourses. They attributed this hasty wedding to the Prince\u2019s\ndread of seeing accomplished an ancient prophecy, which was said to have\npronounced that the castle and lordship of Otranto \u201cshould pass from the\npresent family, whenever the real owner should be grown too large to\ninhabit it.\u201d It was difficult to make any sense of this prophecy; and\nstill less easy to conceive what it had to do with the marriage in\nquestion. Yet these mysteries, or contradictions, did not make the\npopulace adhere the less to their opinion.\n\nYoung Conrad\u2019s birthday was fixed for his espousals. The company was\nassembled in the chapel of the Castle, and everything ready for beginning\nthe divine office, when Conrad himself was missing. Manfred, impatient\nof the least delay, and who had not observed his son retire, despatched\none of his attendants to summon the young Prince. The servant, who had\nnot stayed long enough to have crossed the court to Conrad\u2019s apartment,\ncame running back breathless, in a frantic manner, his eyes staring, and\nfoaming at the mouth.",
  "9": " He said nothing, but pointed to the court.\n\nThe company were struck with terror and amazement. The Princess\nHippolita, without knowing what was the matter, but anxious for her son,\nswooned away. Manfred, less apprehensive than enraged at the\nprocrastination of the nuptials, and at the folly of his domestic, asked\nimperiously what was the matter? The fellow made no answer, but\ncontinued pointing towards the courtyard; and at last, after repeated\nquestions put to him, cried out, \u201cOh! the helmet! the helmet!\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, some of the company had run into the court, from whence\nwas heard a confused noise of shrieks, horror, and surprise. Manfred,\nwho began to be alarmed at not seeing his son, went himself to get\ninformation of what occasioned this strange confusion. Matilda remained\nendeavouring to assist her mother, and Isabella stayed for the same\npurpose, and to avoid showing any impatience for the bridegroom, for\nwhom, in truth, she had conceived little affection.\n\nThe first thing that struck Manfred\u2019s eyes was a group of his servants\nendeavouring to raise something that appeared to him a mountain of sable\nplumes. He gazed without believing his sight.\n\n\u201cWhat are ye doing?\u201d cried Manfred, wrathfully; \u201cwhere is my son?\u201d\n\nA volley of voices replied, \u201cOh! my Lord! the Prince! the Prince! the\nhelmet! the helmet!\u201d\n\nShocked with these lamentable sounds, and dreading he knew not what, he\nadvanced hastily,\u2014but what a sight for a father\u2019s eyes!\u2014he beheld his\nchild dashed to pieces, and almost buried under an enormous helmet, an\nhundred ti",
  "10": "mes more large than any casque ever made for human being, and\nshaded with a proportionable quantity of black feathers.\n\nThe horror of the spectacle, the ignorance of all around how this\nmisfortune had happened, and above all, the tremendous phenomenon before\nhim, took away the Prince\u2019s speech. Yet his silence lasted longer than\neven grief could occasion. He fixed his eyes on what he wished in vain\nto believe a vision; and seemed less attentive to his loss, than buried\nin meditation on the stupendous object that had occasioned it. He\ntouched, he examined the fatal casque; nor could even the bleeding\nmangled remains of the young Prince divert the eyes of Manfred from the\nportent before him.\n\nAll who had known his partial fondness for young Conrad, were as much\nsurprised at their Prince\u2019s insensibility, as thunderstruck themselves at\nthe miracle of the helmet. They conveyed the disfigured corpse into the\nhall, without receiving the least direction from Manfred. As little was\nhe attentive to the ladies who remained in the chapel. On the contrary,\nwithout mentioning the unhappy princesses, his wife and daughter, the\nfirst sounds that dropped from Manfred\u2019s lips were, \u201cTake care of the\nLady Isabella.",
  "11": "\u201d\n\nThe domestics, without observing the singularity of this direction, were\nguided by their affection to their mistress, to consider it as peculiarly\naddressed to her situation, and flew to her assistance. They conveyed\nher to her chamber more dead than alive, and indifferent to all the\nstrange circumstances she heard, except the death of her son.\n\nMatilda, who doted on her mother, smothered her own grief and amazement,\nand thought of nothing but assisting and comforting her afflicted parent.\nIsabella, who had been treated by Hippolita like a daughter, and who\nreturned that tenderness with equal duty and affection, was scarce less\nassiduous about the Princess; at the same time endeavouring to partake\nand lessen the weight of sorrow which she saw Matilda strove to suppress,\nfor whom she had conceived the warmest sympathy of friendship. Yet her\nown situation could not help finding its place in her thoughts.",
  "12": " She felt\nno concern for the death of young Conrad, except commiseration; and she\nwas not sorry to be delivered from a marriage which had promised her\nlittle felicity, either from her destined bridegroom, or from the severe\ntemper of Manfred, who, though he had distinguished her by great\nindulgence, had imprinted her mind with terror, from his causeless rigour\nto such amiable princesses as Hippolita and Matilda.\n\nWhile the ladies were conveying the wretched mother to her bed, Manfred\nremained in the court, gazing on the ominous casque, and regardless of\nthe crowd which the strangeness of the event had now assembled around\nhim. The few words he articulated, tended solely to inquiries, whether\nany man knew from whence it could have come? Nobody could give him the\nleast information. However, as it seemed to be the sole object of his\ncuriosity, it soon became so to the rest of the spectators, whose\nconjectures were as absurd and improbable, as the catastrophe itself was\nunprecedented. In the midst of their senseless guesses, a young peasant,\nwhom rumour had drawn thither from a neighbouring village, observed that\nthe miraculous",
  "13": " helmet was exactly like that on the figure in black marble\nof Alfonso the Good, one of their former princes, in the church of St.\nNicholas.\n\n\u201cVillain! What sayest thou?\u201d cried Manfred, starting from his trance in\na tempest of rage, and seizing the young man by the collar; \u201chow darest\nthou utter such treason? Thy life shall pay for it.\u201d\n\nThe spectators, who as little comprehended the cause of the Prince\u2019s fury\nas all the rest they had seen, were at a loss to unravel this new\ncircumstance. The young peasant himself was still more astonished, not\nconceiving how he had offended the Prince. Yet recollecting himself,\nwith a mixture of grace and humility, he disengaged himself from\nManfred\u2019s grip, and then with an obeisance, which discovered more\njealousy of innocence than dismay, he asked, with respect, of what he was\nguilty? Manfred, more enraged at the vigour, however decently exerted,\nwith which the young man had shaken off his hold, than appeased by his\nsubmission, ordered his attendants to seize him, and, if he had not been\nwithheld by his friends whom he had invited to the nuptials, would have\npoignarded the peasant in their arms.\n\nDuring this altercation, some of the vulgar spectators had run to the\ngreat church, which stood near the castle, and came back open-mouthed,\ndeclaring that the helmet was missing from Alfonso\u2019s statue.",
  "14": " Manfred, at\nthis news, grew perfectly frantic; and, as if he sought a subject on\nwhich to vent the tempest within him, he rushed again on the young\npeasant, crying\u2014\n\n\u201cVillain! Monster! Sorcerer! \u2019tis thou hast done this! \u2019tis thou hast\nslain my son!\u201d\n\nThe mob, who wanted some object within the scope of their capacities, on\nwhom they might discharge their bewildered reasoning, caught the words\nfrom the mouth of their lord, and re-echoed\u2014\n\n\u201cAy, ay; \u2019tis he, \u2019tis he: he has stolen the helmet from good Alfonso\u2019s\ntomb, and dashed out the brains of our young Prince with it,\u201d never\nreflecting how enormous the disproportion was between the marble helmet\nthat had been in the church, and that of steel before their eyes; nor how\nimpossible it was for a youth seemingly not twenty, to wield a piece of\narmour of so prodigious a weight.\n\nThe folly of these ejaculations brought Manfred to himself: yet whether\nprovoked at the peasant having observed the resemblance between the two\nhelmets, and thereby led to the farther discovery of the absence of that\nin the church, or wishing to bury any such rumour under so impertinent a\nsupposition, he gravely pronounced that the young man was certainly a\nnecromancer, and that till the Church could take cognisance of the\naffair, he would have the Magician, ",
  "15": "whom they had thus detected, kept\nprisoner under the helmet itself, which he ordered his attendants to\nraise, and place the young man under it; declaring he should be kept\nthere without food, with which his own infernal art might furnish him.\n\nIt was in vain for the youth to represent against this preposterous\nsentence: in vain did Manfred\u2019s friends endeavour to divert him from this\nsavage and ill-grounded resolution. The generality were charmed with\ntheir lord\u2019s decision, which, to their apprehensions, carried great\nappearance of justice, as the Magician was to be punished by the very\ninstrument with which he had offended: nor were they struck with the\nleast compunction at the probability of the youth being starved, for they\nfirmly believed that, by his diabolic skill, he could easily supply\nhimself with nutriment.\n\nManfred thus saw his commands even cheerfully obeyed; and appointing a\nguard with strict orders to prevent any food being conveyed to the\nprisoner, he dismissed his friends and attendants, and retired to his own\nchamber, after locking the gates of the castle, in which he suffered none\nbut his domestics to remain.\n\nIn the meantime, the care and zeal of the young Ladies had brought the\nPrincess Hippolita to herself, who amidst",
  "16": " the transports of her own\nsorrow frequently demanded news of her lord, would have dismissed her\nattendants to watch over him, and at last enjoined Matilda to leave her,\nand visit and comfort her father. Matilda, who wanted no affectionate\nduty to Manfred, though she trembled at his austerity, obeyed the orders\nof Hippolita, whom she tenderly recommended to Isabella; and inquiring of\nthe domestics for her father, was informed that he was retired to his\nchamber, and had commanded that nobody should have admittance to him.\nConcluding that he was immersed in sorrow for the death of her brother,\nand fearing to renew his tears by the sight of his sole remaining child,\nshe hesitated whether she should break in upon his affliction; yet\nsolicitude for him, backed by the commands of her mother, encouraged her\nto venture disobeying the orders he had given; a fault she had never been\nguilty of before.\n\nThe gentle timidity of her nature made her pause for some minutes at his\ndoor. She heard him traverse his chamber backwards, and forwards with\ndisordered steps; a mood which increased her apprehensions.",
  "17": " She was,\nhowever, just going to beg admittance, when Manfred suddenly opened the\ndoor; and as it was now twilight, concurring with the disorder of his\nmind, he did not distinguish the person, but asked angrily, who it was?\nMatilda replied, trembling\u2014\n\n\u201cMy dearest father, it is I, your daughter.\u201d\n\nManfred, stepping back hastily, cried, \u201cBegone! I do not want a\ndaughter;\u201d and flinging back abruptly, clapped the door against the\nterrified Matilda.\n\nShe was too well acquainted with her father\u2019s impetuosity to venture a\nsecond intrusion. When she had a little recovered the shock of so bitter\na reception, she wiped away her tears to prevent the additional stab that\nthe knowledge of it would give to Hippolita, who questioned her in the\nmost anxious terms on the health of Manfred, and how he bore his loss.\nMatilda assured her he was well, and supported his misfortune with manly\nfortitude.\n\n\u201cBut will he not let me see him?\u201d said Hippolita mournfully; \u201cwill he not\npermit me to blend my tears with his, and shed a mother\u2019s sorrows in the\nbosom of her Lord? Or do you deceive me, Matilda? I know how Manfred\ndoted on his son: is not the stroke too heavy for him? has he not sunk\nunder it? You do not answer me\u2014alas! I dread the worst!\u2014Raise me, my\nmaidens; I will, I will see my Lord. Bear me to him instantly: he is\ndearer to me even than my children.\u201d\n\nMatilda made signs to Isabella to prevent Hippolita\u2019s rising; and both\nthose lovely young women were using their gentle violence to stop and\ncalm the Princess, when a servant, on the part of Manfred, arrived and\ntold Isabella that his Lord demanded to speak with her.\n\n\u201cWith me!\u201d cried Isabella.",
  "18": "\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d said Hippolita, relieved by a message from her Lord: \u201cManfred\ncannot support the sight of his own family. He thinks you less\ndisordered than we are, and dreads the shock of my grief. Console him,\ndear Isabella, and tell him I will smother my own anguish rather than add\nto his.\u201d\n\nAs it was now evening the servant who conducted Isabella bore a torch\nbefore her. When they came to Manfred, who was walking impatiently about\nthe gallery, he started, and said hastily\u2014\n\n\u201cTake away that light, and begone.\u201d\n\nThen shutting the door impetuously, he flung himself upon a bench against\nthe wall, and bade Isabella sit by him. She obeyed trembling.\n\n\u201cI sent for you, Lady,\u201d said he\u2014and then stopped under great appearance\nof confusion.\n\n\u201cMy Lord!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I sent for you on a matter of great moment,\u201d resumed he. \u201cDry your\ntears, young Lady\u2014you have lost your bridegroom. Yes, cruel fate! and I\nhave lost the hopes of my race! But Conrad was not worthy of your\nbeauty.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow, my Lord!\u201d said Isabella; \u201csure you do not suspect me of not feeling\nthe concern I ought: my duty and affection would have always\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThink no more of him,\u201d interrupted Manfred; \u201che was a sickly, puny\nchild, and Heaven has perhaps taken him away, that I might not trust the\nhonours of my house on so frail a foundation. The line of Manfred calls\nfor numerous supports. My foolish fondness for that boy blinded the eyes\nof my prudence\u2014but it is better as it is. I hope, in a few years, to\nhave reason to rejoice at the death of Conrad.\u201d\n\nWords cannot paint the astonishment of Isabella. At first she\napprehended that grief had disordered Manfred\u2019s understanding.",
  "19": " Her next\nthought suggested that this strange discourse was designed to ensnare\nher: she feared that Manfred had perceived her indifference for his son:\nand in consequence of that idea she replied\u2014\n\n\u201cGood my Lord, do not doubt my tenderness: my heart would have\naccompanied my hand. Conrad would have engrossed all my care; and\nwherever fate shall dispose of me, I shall always cherish his memory, and\nregard your Highness and the virtuous Hippolita as my parents.\u201d\n\n\u201cCurse on Hippolita!\u201d cried Manfred. \u201cForget her from this moment, as I\ndo. In short, Lady, you have missed a husband undeserving of your\ncharms: they shall now be better disposed of. Instead of a sickly boy,\nyou shall have a husband in the prime of his age, who will know how to\nvalue your beauties, and who may expect a numerous offspring.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlas, my Lord!\u201d said Isabella, \u201cmy mind is too sadly engrossed by the\nrecent catastrophe in your family to think of another marriage. If ever\nmy father returns, and it shall be his pleasure, I shall obey, as I did\nwhen I consented to give my hand to your son: but until his return,\npermit me to remain under your hospitable roof, and employ the melancholy\nhours in assuaging yours, Hippolita\u2019s, and the fair Matilda\u2019s\naffliction.\u201d\n\n\u201cI desired you once before,\u201d said Manfred angrily, \u201cnot to name that\nwoman: from this hour she must be a stranger to you, as she must be to\nme. In short, Isabella, since I cannot give you my son, I offer you\nmyself.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeavens!\u201d cried Isabella, waking from her delusion, \u201cwhat do I hear?\nYou! my Lord! You!

What sound was that?\u201d and at the same time made towards\nthe door.\n\nManfred, distracted between the flight of Isabella, who had now reached\nthe stairs, and yet unable to keep his eyes from the picture, which began\nto move, had, however, advanced some steps after her, still looking\nbackwards on the portrait, when he saw it quit its panel, and descend on\nthe floor with a grave and melancholy air.",
  "21": "\n\n\u201cDo I dream?\u201d cried Manfred, returning; \u201cor are the devils themselves in\nleague against me? Speak, infernal spectre!

Manfred accompanied him at\na little distance, full of anxiety and horror, but resolved. As he would\nhave entered the chamber, the door was clapped to with violence by an\ninvisible hand. The Prince, collecting courage from this delay, would\nhave forcibly burst open the door with his foot, but found that it\nresisted his utmost efforts.\n\n\u201cSince Hell will not satisfy my curiosity,\u201d said Manfred, \u201cI will use the\nhuman means in my power for preserving my race; Isabella shall not escape\nme.",
  "22": "\u201d\n\nThe lady, whose resolution had given way to terror the moment she had\nquitted Manfred, continued her flight to the bottom of the principal\nstaircase. There she stopped, not knowing whither to direct her steps,\nnor how to escape from the impetuosity of the Prince. The gates of the\ncastle, she knew, were locked, and guards placed in the court. Should\nshe, as her heart prompted her, go and prepare Hippolita for the cruel\ndestiny that awaited her, she did not doubt but Manfred would seek her\nthere, and that his violence would incite him to double the injury he\nmeditated, without leaving room for them to avoid the impetuosity of his\npassions. Delay might give him time to reflect on the horrid measures he\nhad conceived, or produce some circumstance in her favour, if she\ncould\u2014for that night, at least\u2014avoid his odious purpose. Yet where\nconceal herself? How avoid the pursuit he would infallibly make\nthroughout the castle?\n\nAs these thoughts passed rapidly through her mind, she recollected a\nsubterraneous passage which led from the vaults of the castle to the\nchurch of St. Nicholas. Could she reach the altar before she was\novertaken, she knew even Manfred\u2019s violence would not dare to profane the\nsacredness of the place; and she determined, if no other means o",

In this resolution, she\nseized a lamp that burned at the foot of the staircase, and hurried\ntowards the secret passage.\n\nThe lower part of the castle was hollowed into several intricate\ncloisters; and it was not easy for one under so much anxiety to find the\ndoor that opened into the cavern. An awful silence reigned throughout\nthose subterraneous regions, except now and then some blasts of wind that\nshook the doors she had passed, and which, grating on the rusty hinges,\nwere re-echoed through that long labyrinth of darkness. Every murmur\nstruck her with new terror; yet more she dreaded to hear the wrathful\nvoice of Manfred urging his domestics to pursue her.\n\nShe trod as softly as impatience would give her leave, yet frequently\nstopped and listened to hear if she was followed. In one of those\nmoments she thought she heard a sigh. She shuddered, and recoiled a few\npaces. In a moment she thought she heard the step of some person. Her\nblood curdled; she concluded it was Manfred. Every suggestion that\nhorror could inspire rushed into her mind.",
  "24": " She condemned her rash\nflight, which had thus exposed her to his rage in a place where her cries\nwere not likely to draw anybody to her assistance. Yet the sound seemed\nnot to come from behind. If Manfred knew where she was, he must have\nfollowed her. She was still in one of the cloisters, and the steps she\nhad heard were too distinct to proceed from the way she had come.\nCheered with this reflection, and hoping to find a friend in whoever was\nnot the Prince, she was going to advance, when a door that stood ajar, at\nsome distance to the left, was opened gently: but ere her lamp, which she\nheld up, could discover who opened it, the person retreated precipitately\non seeing the light.\n\nIsabella, whom every incident was sufficient to dismay, hesitated whether\nshe should proceed. Her dread of Manfred soon outweighed every other\nterror. The very circumstance of the person avoiding her gave her a sort\nof courage. It could only be, she thought, some domestic belonging to\nthe castle. Her gentleness had never raised her an enemy, and conscious\ninnocence made her hope that, unless sent by the Prince\u2019s order to seek\nher, his servants would rather assist than prevent her flight.\nFortifying herself with these reflections, and believing by what she\ncould observe that she was near the mouth of the subterraneous cavern,\nshe approached the door that had been opened; but a sudden gust of wind\nthat met her at the door extinguished her lamp, and left her in total\ndarkness.\n\nWords cannot paint the horror of the Princess\u2019s situation.",
  "25": " Alone in so\ndismal a place, her mind imprinted with all the terrible events of the\nday, hopeless of escaping, expecting every moment the arrival of Manfred,\nand far from tranquil on knowing she was within reach of somebody, she\nknew not whom, who for some cause seemed concealed thereabouts; all these\nthoughts crowded on her distracted mind, and she was ready to sink under\nher apprehensions. She addressed herself to every saint in heaven, and\ninwardly implored their assistance. For a considerable time she remained\nin an agony of despair.\n\nAt last, as softly as was possible, she felt for the door, and having\nfound it, entered trembling into the vault from whence she had heard the\nsigh and steps. It gave her a kind of momentary joy to perceive an\nimperfect ray of clouded moonshine gleam from the roof of the vault,\nwhich seemed to be fallen in, and from whence hung a fragment of earth or\nbuilding, she could not distinguish which, that appeared to have been\ncrushed inwards. She advanced eagerly towards this chasm, when she\ndiscerned a human form standing close against the wall.\n\nShe shrieked, believing it the ghost of her betrothed Conrad. The\nfigure, advancing, said, in a submissive voice\u2014\n\n\u201cBe not alarmed, Lady; I will not injure you.\u201d\n\nIsabella, a little encouraged by the words and tone of voice of the\nstranger, and recollecting that this must be the person who ha",

My life\nis of consequence to nobody; I fear no bad angel, and have offended no\ngood one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour behaviour is above your seeming,\u201d said Manfred, viewing him with\nsurprise and admiration\u2014\u201chereafter I will reward your bravery\u2014but now,\u201d\ncontinued he with a sigh, \u201cI am so circumstanced, that I dare trust no\neyes but my own. However, I give you leave to accompany me.\u201d\n\nManfred, when he first followed Isabella from the gallery, had gone\ndirectly to the apartment of his wife, concluding the Princess had\nretired thither. Hippolita, who knew his step, rose with anxious\nfondness to meet her Lord, whom she had not seen since the death of their\nson. She would have flown in a transport mixed of joy and grief to his\nbosom, but he pushed her rudely off, and said\u2014\n\n\u201cWhere is Isabella?\u201d\n\n\u201cIsabella! my Lord!\u201d said the astonished Hippolita.\n\n\u201cYes, Isabella,\u201d cried Manfred imperiously; \u201cI want Isabella.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d replied Matilda, who perceived how much his behaviour had\nshocked her mother, \u201cshe has not been with us since your Highness\nsummoned her to your apartment.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me where she is,\u201d said the Prince; \u201cI do not want to know where she\nhas been.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy good Lord,\u201d says Hippolita, \u201cyour daughter tells you the truth:\nIsabella left us by your command, and has not returned since;\u2014but, my\ngood Lord, compose yourself: retire to your rest: this dismal day has\ndisordered you. Isabella shall wait your orders in the morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, then, you know where she is!\u201d cried Manfred. \u201cTell me directly,\nfor I will not lose an instant\u2014and you, woman,\u201d speaking to his wife,\n\u201corder your chaplain to attend me forthwith.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsabella,\u201d said Hippolita calmly, \u201cis retired, I suppose, to her\nchamber: she is not accustomed to watch at this late hour.",
  "36": " Gracious my\nLord,\u201d continued she, \u201clet me know what has disturbed you. Has Isabella\noffended you?\u201d\n\n\u201cTrouble me not with questions,\u201d said Manfred, \u201cbut tell me where she\nis.\u201d\n\n\u201cMatilda shall call her,\u201d said the Princess. \u201cSit down, my Lord, and\nresume your wonted fortitude.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, art thou jealous of Isabella?\u201d replied he, \u201cthat you wish to be\npresent at our interview!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood heavens! my Lord,\u201d said Hippolita, \u201cwhat is it your Highness\nmeans?\u201d\n\n\u201cThou wilt know ere many minutes are passed,\u201d said the cruel Prince.\n\u201cSend your chaplain to me, and wait my pleasure here.\u201d\n\nAt these words he flung out of the room in search of Isabella, leaving\nthe amazed ladies thunderstruck with his words and frantic deportment,\nand lost in vain conjectures on what he was meditating.\n\nManfred was now returning from the vault, attended by the peasant and a\nfew of his servants whom he had obliged to accompany him. He ascended\nthe staircase without stopping till he arrived at the gallery, at the\ndoor of which he met Hippolita and her chaplain. When Diego had been\ndismissed by Manfred, he had gone directly to the Princess\u2019s apartment\nwith the alarm of what he had seen. That excellent Lady, who no more\nthan Manfred doubted of the reality of the vision, yet affected to treat\nit as a delirium of the servant. Willing, however, to save her Lord from\nany additional shock, and prepared by a series of griefs not to tremble\nat any accession to it, she determined to make herself the first\nsacrifice, if fate had marked the present hour for their destruction.",
  "37": "\nDismissing the reluctant Matilda to her rest, who in vain sued for leave\nto accompany her mother, and attended only by her chaplain, Hippolita had\nvisited the gallery and great chamber; and now with more serenity of soul\nthan she had felt for many hours, she met her Lord, and assured him that\nthe vision of the gigantic leg and foot was all a fable; and no doubt an\nimpression made by fear, and the dark and dismal hour of the night, on\nthe minds of his servants. She and the chaplain had examined the\nchamber, and found everything in the usual order.\n\nManfred, though persuaded, like his wife, that the vision had been no\nwork of fancy, recovered a little from the tempest of mind into which so\nmany strange events had thrown him. Ashamed, too, of his inhuman\ntreatment of a Princess who returned every injury with new marks of\ntenderness and duty, he felt returning love forcing itself into his eyes;\nbut not less ashamed of feeling remorse towards one against whom he was\ninwardly meditating a yet more bitter outrage, he curbed the yearnings of\nhis heart, and did not dare to lean even towards pity. The next\ntransition of his soul was to exquisite villainy.\n\nPresuming on the unshaken submission of Hippolita, he flattered himself\nthat she would not only acquiesce with patience to a divorce, but would\nobey, if it was his pleasure, in endeavouring to persuade Isabella to\ngive him her hand\u2014but ere he could indulge his horrid hope, he reflected\nthat Isabella was not to be found. Coming to himself, he gave orders\nthat every avenue to the castle should be strictly guarded, and charged\nhis domestics on pain of their lives to suffer nobody to pass out. The\nyoung peasant, to whom he spoke favourably, he ordered to remain in a\nsmall chamber on the stairs, in which there was a pallet-bed, and the key\nof which he took away himself, telling the youth he would talk with him\nin the morning.",
  "38": " Then dismissing his attendants, and bestowing a sullen\nkind of half-nod on Hippolita, he retired to his own chamber.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nMatilda, who by Hippolita\u2019s order had retired to her apartment, was\nill-disposed to take any rest. The shocking fate of her brother had\ndeeply affected her. She was surprised at not seeing Isabella; but the\nstrange words which had fallen from her father, and his obscure menace to\nthe Princess his wife, accompanied by the most furious behaviour, had\nfilled her gentle mind with terror and alarm. She waited anxiously for\nthe return of Bianca, a young damsel that attended her, whom she had sent\nto learn what was become of Isabella. Bianca soon appeared, and informed\nher mistress of what she had gathered from the servants, that Isabella\nwas nowhere to be found. She related the adventure of the young peasant\nwho had been discovered in the vault, though with many simple additions\nfrom the incoherent accounts of the domestics; and she dwelt principally\non the gigantic leg and foot which had been seen in the gallery-chamber.\nThis last circumstance had terrified Bianca so much, that she was\nrejoiced when Matilda told her that she would not go to rest, but would\nwatch till the Princess should rise.\n\nThe young Princess wearied herself in conjectures on the flight of\nIsabella, and on the threats of Manfred to her mother. \u201cBut what\nbusiness could he have so urgent with the chaplain?\u201d said Matilda, \u201cDoes\nhe intend to have my brother\u2019s body interred privately in the chapel?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Madam!\u201d said Bianca, \u201cnow I guess.",
  "39": " As you are become his heiress,\nhe is impatient to have you married: he has always been raving for more\nsons; I warrant he is now impatient for grandsons. As sure as I live,\nMadam, I shall see you a bride at last.\u2014Good madam, you won\u2019t cast off\nyour faithful Bianca: you won\u2019t put Donna Rosara over me now you are a\ngreat Princess.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy poor Bianca,\u201d said Matilda, \u201chow fast your thoughts amble! I a great\nprincess! What hast thou seen in Manfred\u2019s behaviour since my brother\u2019s\ndeath that bespeaks any increase of tenderness to me? No, Bianca; his\nheart was ever a stranger to me\u2014but he is my father, and I must not\ncomplain. Nay, if Heaven shuts my father\u2019s heart against me, it overpays\nmy little merit in the tenderness of my mother\u2014O that dear mother! yes,\nBianca, \u2019tis there I feel the rugged temper of Manfred. I can support\nhis harshness to me with patience; but it wounds my soul when I am\nwitness to his causeless severity towards her.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! Madam,\u201d said Bianca, \u201call men use their wives so, when they are\nweary of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet you congratulated me but now,\u201d said Matilda, \u201cwhen you fancied\nmy father intended to dispose of me!\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have you a great Lady,\u201d replied Bianca, \u201ccome what will.",
  "40": " I do\nnot wish to see you moped in a convent, as you would be if you had your\nwill, and if my Lady, your mother, who knows that a bad husband is better\nthan no husband at all, did not hinder you.\u2014Bless me! what noise is that!\nSt. Nicholas forgive me! I was but in jest.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the wind,\u201d said Matilda, \u201cwhistling through the battlements in the\ntower above: you have heard it a thousand times.\u201d\n\n\u201cNay,\u201d said Bianca, \u201cthere was no harm neither in what I said: it is no\nsin to talk of matrimony\u2014and so, Madam, as I was saying, if my Lord\nManfred should offer you a handsome young Prince for a bridegroom, you\nwould drop him a curtsey, and tell him you would rather take the veil?\u201d\n\n\u201cThank Heaven! I am in no such danger,\u201d said Matilda: \u201cyou know how many\nproposals for me he has rejected\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you thank him, like a dutiful daughter, do you, Madam? But come,\nMadam; suppose, to-morrow morning, he was to send for you to the great\ncouncil chamber, and there you should find at his elbow a lovely young\nPrince, with large black eyes, a smooth white forehead, and manly curling\nlocks like jet; in short, Madam, a young hero resembling the picture of\nthe good Alfonso in the gallery, which you sit and gaze at for hours\ntogether\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not speak lightly of that picture,\u201d interrupted Matilda sighing; \u201cI\nknow the adoration with which I look at that picture is uncommon\u2014but I am\nnot in love with a coloured panel. The character of that virtuous\nPrince, the veneration with which my mother has inspired me for his\nmemory, the orisons which, I know not why, she has enjoined me to pour\nforth at his tomb, all have concurred to persuade me that somehow or\nother my destiny is linked with something relating to him.",
  "41": "\u201d\n\n\u201cLord, Madam! how should that be?\u201d said Bianca; \u201cI have always heard that\nyour family was in no way related to his: and I am sure I cannot conceive\nwhy my Lady, the Princess, sends you in a cold morning or a damp evening\nto pray at his tomb: he is no saint by the almanack. If you must pray,\nwhy does she not bid you address yourself to our great St. Nicholas? I\nam sure he is the saint I pray to for a husband.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps my mind would be less affected,\u201d said Matilda, \u201cif my mother\nwould explain her reasons to me: but it is the mystery she observes, that\ninspires me with this\u2014I know not what to call it. As she never acts from\ncaprice, I am sure there is some fatal secret at bottom\u2014nay, I know there\nis: in her agony of grief for my brother\u2019s death she dropped some words\nthat intimated as much.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! dear Madam,\u201d cried Bianca, \u201cwhat were they?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Matilda, \u201cif a parent lets fall a word, and wishes it\nrecalled, it is not for a child to utter it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat! was she sorry for what she had said?\u201d asked Bianca; \u201cI am sure,\nMadam, you may trust me\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWith my own little secrets when I have any, I may,\u201d said Matilda; \u201cbut\nnever with my mother\u2019s: a child ought to have no ears or eyes but as a\nparent directs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell! to be sure, Madam, you were born to be a saint,\u201d said Bianca, \u201cand\nthere is no resisting one\u2019s vocation: you will end in a convent at last.\nBut there is my Lady Isabella would not be so reserved to me: she will\nlet me talk to her of young men: and when a handsome cavalier has come to\nthe castle, she has owned to me that she wished your brother Conrad\nresembled him.\u201d\n\n\u201cBianca,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cI do not allow you to mention my friend\ndisrespectfully. Isabella is of a cheerful disposition, but her soul is\npure as virtue itself.

Madam,\u201d said Bianca, half-weeping with agony, \u201cI am\nsure I heard a voice.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes anybody lie in the chamber beneath?\u201d said the Princess.\n\n\u201cNobody has dared to lie there,\u201d answered Bianca, \u201csince the great\nastrologer, that was your brother\u2019s tutor, drowned himself. For certain,\nMadam, his ghost and the young Prince\u2019s are now met in the chamber\nbelow\u2014for Heaven\u2019s sake let us fly to your mother\u2019s apartment!\u201d\n\n\u201cI charge you not to stir,\u201d said Matilda. \u201cIf they are spirits in pain,\nwe may ease their sufferings by questioning them. They can mean no hurt\nto us, for we have not injured them\u2014and if they should, shall we be more\nsafe in one chamber than in another? Reach me my beads; we will say a\nprayer, and then speak to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! dear Lady, I would not speak to a ghost for the world!\u201d cried\nBianca. As she said those words they heard the casement of the little\nchamber below Matilda\u2019s open. They listened attentively, and in a few\nminutes thought they heard a person sing, but could not distinguish the\nwords.\n\n\u201cThis can be no evil spirit,\u201d said the Princess, in a low voice; \u201cit is\nundoubtedly one of the family\u2014open the window, and we shall know the\nvoice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI dare not, indeed, Madam,\u201d said Bianca.\n\n\u201cThou art a very fool,\u201d said Matilda, opening the window gently herself.\nThe noise the Princess made was, however, heard by the person beneath,\nwho stopped; and they concluded had heard the casement open.\n\n\u201cIs anybody below?\u201d said the Princess; \u201cif there is, speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said an unknown voice.\n\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d said Matilda.\n\n\u201cA stranger,\u201d replied the voice.\n\n\u201cWhat stranger?\u201d said she; \u201cand how didst thou come there at this unusual\nhour, when all the gates of the castle are locked?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not here willingly,\u201d answered the voice.",

How are we entitled to his\nconfidence?\u201d\n\n\u201cLord, Madam! how little you know of love!\u201d replied Bianca; \u201cwhy, lovers\nhave no pleasure equal to talking of their mistress.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd would you have _me_ become a peasant\u2019s confidante?\u201d said the\nPrincess.\n\n\u201cWell, then, let me talk to him,\u201d said Bianca; \u201cthough I have the honour\nof being your Highness\u2019s maid of honour, I was not always so great.\nBesides, if love levels ranks, it raises them too; I have a respect for\nany young man in love.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeace, simpleton!\u201d said the Princess. \u201cThough he said he was unhappy,\nit does not follow that he must be in love.

I have\noften suspected Isabella\u2019s indifference to my son: a thousand\ncircumstances crowd on my mind that confirm that suspicion. She herself\nwas so conscious of it, that while I discoursed her in the gallery, she\noutran my suspicions, and endeavoured to justify herself from coolness to\nConrad.\u201d\n\nThe Friar, who knew nothing of the youth, but what he had learnt\noccasionally from the Princess, ignorant what was become of him, and not\nsufficiently reflecting on the impetuosity of Manfred\u2019s temper, conceived\nthat it might not be amiss to sow the seeds of jealousy in his mind: they\nmight be turned to some use hereafter, either by prejudicing the Prince\nagainst Isabella, if he persisted in that union or by diverting his\nattention to a wrong scent, and employing his thoughts on a visionary\nintrigue, prevent his engaging in any new pursuit. With this unhappy\npolicy, he answered in a manner to confirm Manfred in the belief of some\nconnection between Isabella and the youth. The Prince, whose passions\nwanted little fuel to throw them into a blaze, fell into a rage at the\nidea of what the Friar suggested.\n\n\u201cI will fathom to the bottom of this intrigue,\u201d cried he; and quitting\nJerome abruptly, with a command to remain there till his return, he\nhastened to the great hall of the castle, and ordered the peasant to be\nbrought before him.",

  "64": " But\nalas! my Lord, what is blood! what is nobility! We are all reptiles,\nmiserable, sinful creatures. It is piety alone that can distinguish us\nfrom the dust whence we sprung, and whither we must return.\u201d\n\n\u201cTruce to your sermon,\u201d said Manfred; \u201cyou forget you are no longer Friar\nJerome, but the Count of Falconara. Let me know your history; you will\nhave time to moralise hereafter, if you should not happen to obtain the\ngrace of that sturdy criminal there.\u201d\n\n\u201cMother of God!\u201d said the Friar, \u201cis it possible my Lord can refuse a\nfather the life of his only, his long-lost, child! Trample me, my Lord,\nscorn, afflict me, accept my life for his, but spare my son!\u201d\n\n\u201cThou canst feel, then,\u201d said Manfred, \u201cwhat it is to lose an only son!\nA little hour ago thou didst preach up resignation to me: _my_ house, if\nfate so pleased, must perish\u2014but the Count of Falconara\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAlas! my Lord,\u201d said Jerome, \u201cI confess I have offended; but aggravate\nnot an old man\u2019s sufferings! I boast not of my family, nor think of such\nvanities\u2014it is nature, that pleads for this boy; it is the memory of the\ndear woman that bore him.",
  "65": " Is she, Theodore, is she dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer soul has long been with the blessed,\u201d said Theodore.\n\n\u201cOh! how?\u201d cried Jerome, \u201ctell me\u2014no\u2014she is happy! Thou art all my care\nnow!\u2014Most dread Lord! will you\u2014will you grant me my poor boy\u2019s life?\u201d\n\n\u201cReturn to thy convent,\u201d answered Manfred; \u201cconduct the Princess hither;\nobey me in what else thou knowest; and I promise thee the life of thy\nson.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! my Lord,\u201d said Jerome, \u201cis my honesty the price I must pay for this\ndear youth\u2019s safety?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me!\u201d cried Theodore. \u201cLet me die a thousand deaths, rather than\nstain thy conscience. What is it the tyrant would exact of thee? Is the\nPrincess still safe from his power? Protect her, thou venerable old man;\nand let all the weight of his wrath fall on me.\u201d\n\nJerome endeavoured to check the impetuosity of the youth; and ere Manfred\ncould reply, the trampling of horses was heard, and a brazen trumpet,\nwhich hung without the gate of the castle, was suddenly sounded.",
  "66": " At the\nsame instant the sable plumes on the enchanted helmet, which still\nremained at the other end of the court, were tempestuously agitated, and\nnodded thrice, as if bowed by some invisible wearer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nManfred\u2019s heart misgave him when he beheld the plumage on the miraculous\ncasque shaken in concert with the sounding of the brazen trumpet.\n\n\u201cFather!\u201d said he to Jerome, whom he now ceased to treat as Count of\nFalconara, \u201cwhat mean these portents? If I have offended\u2014\u201d the plumes\nwere shaken with greater violence than before.\n\n\u201cUnhappy Prince that I am,\u201d cried Manfred. \u201cHoly Father! will you not\nassist me with your prayers?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d replied Jerome, \u201cheaven is no doubt displeased with your\nmockery of its servants. Submit yourself to the church; and cease to\npersecute her ministers. Dismiss this innocent youth; and learn to\nrespect the holy character I wear. Heaven will not be trifled with: you\nsee\u2014\u201d the trumpet sounded again.\n\n\u201cI acknowledge I have been too hasty,\u201d said Manfred. \u201cFather, do you go\nto the wicket, and demand who is at the gate.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you grant me the life of Theodore?\u201d replied the Friar.\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d said Manfred; \u201cbut inquire who is without!\u201d\n\nJerome, falling on the neck of his son, discharged a flood of tears, that\nspoke the fulness of his soul.",
  "67": "\n\n\u201cYou promised to go to the gate,\u201d said Manfred.\n\n\u201cI thought,\u201d replied the Friar, \u201cyour Highness would excuse my thanking\nyou first in this tribute of my heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo, dearest Sir,\u201d said Theodore; \u201cobey the Prince. I do not deserve\nthat you should delay his satisfaction for me.\u201d\n\nJerome, inquiring who was without, was answered, \u201cA Herald.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom whom?\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cFrom the Knight of the Gigantic Sabre,\u201d said the Herald; \u201cand I must\nspeak with the usurper of Otranto.\u201d\n\nJerome returned to the Prince, and did not fail to repeat the message in\nthe very words it had been uttered. The first sounds struck Manfred with\nterror; but when he heard himself styled usurper, his rage rekindled, and\nall his courage revived.\n\n\u201cUsurper!\u2014insolent villain!\u201d cried he; \u201cwho dares to question my title?\nRetire, Father; this is no business for Monks: I will meet this\npresumptuous man myself. Go to your convent and prepare the Princess\u2019s\nreturn. Your son shall be a hostage for your fidelity: his life depends\non your obedience.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood heaven! my Lord,\u201d cried Jerome, \u201cyour Highness did but this instant\nfreely pardon my child\u2014have you so soon forgot the interposition of\nheaven?\u201d\n\n\u201cHeaven,\u201d replied Manfred, \u201cdoes not send Heralds to question the title\nof a lawful Prince. I doubt whether it even notifies its will through\nFriars\u2014but that is your affair, not mine. At present you know my\npleasure; and it is not a saucy Herald that shall save your son, if you\ndo not return with the Princess.",
  "68": "\u201d\n\nIt was in vain for the holy man to reply. Manfred commanded him to be\nconducted to the postern-gate, and shut out from the castle. And he\nordered some of his attendants to carry Theodore to the top of the black\ntower, and guard him strictly; scarce permitting the father and son to\nexchange a hasty embrace at parting. He then withdrew to the hall, and\nseating himself in princely state, ordered the Herald to be admitted to\nhis presence.\n\n\u201cWell! thou insolent!\u201d said the Prince, \u201cwhat wouldst thou with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI come,\u201d replied he, \u201cto thee, Manfred, usurper of the principality of\nOtranto, from the renowned and invincible Knight, the Knight of the\nGigantic Sabre: in the name of his Lord, Frederic, Marquis of Vicenza, he\ndemands the Lady Isabella, daughter of that Prince, whom thou hast basely\nand traitorously got into thy power, by bribing her false guardians\nduring his absence; and he requires thee to resign the principality of\nOtranto, which thou hast usurped from the said Lord Frederic, the nearest\nof blood to the last rightful Lord, Alfonso the Good. If thou dost not\ninstantly comply with these just demands, he defies thee to single combat\nto the last extremity.\u201d And so saying the Herald cast down his warder.\n\n\u201cAnd where is this braggart who sends thee?\u201d said Manfred.\n\n\u201cAt the distance of a league,\u201d said the Herald: \u201che comes to make good\nhis Lord\u2019s claim against thee, as he is a true knight, and thou an\nusurper and ravisher.\u201d\n\nInjurious as this challenge was, Manfred reflected that it was not his\ninterest to provoke the Marquis. He knew how well founded the claim of\nFrederic was; nor was this the first time he had heard of it. Frederic\u2019s\nancestors had assumed the style of Princes of Otranto, from the death of\nAlfonso the Good without issue; but Man",
  "69": "fred, his father, and grandfather,\nhad been too powerful for the house of Vicenza to dispossess them.\nFrederic, a martial and amorous young Prince, had married a beautiful\nyoung lady, of whom he was enamoured, and who had died in childbed of\nIsabella. Her death affected him so much that he had taken the cross and\ngone to the Holy Land, where he was wounded in an engagement against the\ninfidels, made prisoner, and reported to be dead. When the news reached\nManfred\u2019s ears, he bribed the guardians of the Lady Isabella to deliver\nher up to him as a bride for his son Conrad, by which alliance he had\nproposed to unite the claims of the two houses. This motive, on Conrad\u2019s\ndeath, had co-operated to make him so suddenly resolve on espousing her\nhimself; and the same reflection determined him now to endeavour at\nobtaining the consent of Frederic to this marriage. A like policy\ninspired him with the thought of inviting Frederic\u2019s champion into the\ncastle, lest he should be informed of Isabella\u2019s flight, which he\nstrictly enjoined his domestics not to disclose to any of the Knight\u2019s\nretinue.\n\n\u201cHerald,\u201d said Manfred, as soon as he had digested these reflections,\n\u201creturn to thy master, and tell him, ere we liquidate our differences by\nthe sword, Manfred would hold some converse with him. Bid him welcome to\nmy castle, where by my faith, as I am a true Knight, he shall have\ncourteous reception, and full security for himself and followers. If we\ncannot adjust our quarrel by amicable means, I swear he shall depart in\nsafety, and shall have full satisfaction according to the laws of arms:\nSo help me God and His holy Trinity!\u201d\n\nThe Herald made three obeisances and retired.\n\nDuring this interview Jerome\u2019s mind was agitated by a thousand contrary\npassions. He trembled for the life of his son, and his first thought was\nto persuade Isabella to return to the castle. Yet he was scarce less\nalarmed at the thought of her union with Manfred.",
  "70": " He dreaded Hippolita\u2019s\nunbounded submission to the will of her Lord; and though he did not doubt\nbut he could alarm her piety not to consent to a divorce, if he could get\naccess to her; yet should Manfred discover that the obstruction came from\nhim, it might be equally fatal to Theodore. He was impatient to know\nwhence came the Herald, who with so little management had questioned the\ntitle of Manfred: yet he did not dare absent himself from the convent,\nlest Isabella should leave it, and her flight be imputed to him. He\nreturned disconsolately to the monastery, uncertain on what conduct to\nresolve. A Monk, who met him in the porch and observed his melancholy\nair, said\u2014\n\n\u201cAlas! brother, is it then true that we have lost our excellent Princess\nHippolita?\u201d\n\nThe holy man started, and cried, \u201cWhat meanest thou, brother? I come\nthis instant from the castle, and left her in perfect health.\u201d\n\n\u201cMartelli,\u201d replied the other Friar, \u201cpassed by the convent but a quarter\nof an hour ago on his way from the castle, and reported that her Highness\nwas dead. All our brethren are gone to the chapel to pray for her happy\ntransit to a better life, and willed me to wait thy arrival. They know\nthy holy attachment to that good Lady, and are anxious for the affliction\nit will cause in thee\u2014indeed we have all reason to weep; she was a mother\nto our house.",
  "71": " But this life is but a pilgrimage; we must not murmur\u2014we\nshall all follow her! May our end be like hers!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood brother, thou dreamest,\u201d said Jerome. \u201cI tell thee I come from the\ncastle, and left the Princess well. Where is the Lady Isabella?\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor Gentlewoman!\u201d replied the Friar; \u201cI told her the sad news, and\noffered her spiritual comfort. I reminded her of the transitory\ncondition of mortality, and advised her to take the veil: I quoted the\nexample of the holy Princess Sanchia of Arragon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThy zeal was laudable,\u201d said Jerome, impatiently; \u201cbut at present it was\nunnecessary: Hippolita is well\u2014at least I trust in the Lord she is; I\nheard nothing to the contrary\u2014yet, methinks, the Prince\u2019s\nearnestness\u2014Well, brother, but where is the Lady Isabella?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know not,\u201d said the Friar; \u201cshe wept much, and said she would retire\nto her chamber.\u201d\n\nJerome left his comrade abruptly, and hastened to the Princess, but she\nwas not in her chamber. He inquired of the domestics of the convent, but\ncould learn no news of her. He searched in vain throughout the monastery\nand the church, and despatched messengers round the neighbourhood, to get\nintelligence if she had been seen; but to no purpose. Nothing could\nequal the good man\u2019s perplexity. He judged that Isabella, suspecting\nManfred of having precipitated his wife\u2019s death, had taken the alarm, and\nwithdrawn herself to some more secret place of concealment. This new\nflight would probably carry the Prince\u2019s fury to the height.",
  "72": " The report\nof Hippolita\u2019s death, though it seemed almost incredible, increased his\nconsternation; and though Isabella\u2019s escape bespoke her aversion of\nManfred for a husband, Jerome could feel no comfort from it, while it\nendangered the life of his son. He determined to return to the castle,\nand made several of his brethren accompany him to attest his innocence to\nManfred, and, if necessary, join their intercession with his for\nTheodore.\n\nThe Prince, in the meantime, had passed into the court, and ordered the\ngates of the castle to be flung open for the reception of the stranger\nKnight and his train. In a few minutes the cavalcade arrived. First\ncame two harbingers with wands. Next a herald, followed by two pages and\ntwo trumpets. Then a hundred foot-guards. These were attended by as\nmany horse. After them fifty footmen, clothed in scarlet and black, the\ncolours of the Knight. Then a led horse. Two heralds on each side of a\ngentleman on horseback bearing a banner with the arms of Vicenza and\nOtranto quarterly\u2014a circumstance that much offended Manfred\u2014but he\nstifled his resentment. Two more pages. The Knight\u2019s confessor telling\nhis beads. Fifty more footmen clad as before. Two Knights habited in\ncomplete armour, their beavers down, comrades to the principal Knight.\nThe squires of the two Knights, carrying their shields and devices. The\nKnight\u2019s own squire. A hundred gentlemen bearing an enormous sword, and\nseeming to faint under the weight of it. The Knight himself on a\nchestnut steed, in complete armour, his lance in the rest, his face\nentirely concealed by his vizor, which was surmounted by a large plume of\nscarlet and black feathers. Fifty foot-guards with drums and trumpets\nclosed the procession, which wheeled off to the right and left to make\nroom for the principal Knight.",
  "73": "\n\nAs soon as he approached the gate he stopped; and the herald advancing,\nread again the words of the challenge. Manfred\u2019s eyes were fixed on the\ngigantic sword, and he scarce seemed to attend to the cartel: but his\nattention was soon diverted by a tempest of wind that rose behind him.\nHe turned and beheld the Plumes of the enchanted helmet agitated in the\nsame extraordinary manner as before. It required intrepidity like\nManfred\u2019s not to sink under a concurrence of circumstances that seemed to\nannounce his fate. Yet scorning in the presence of strangers to betray\nthe courage he had always manifested, he said boldly\u2014\n\n\u201cSir Knight, whoever thou art, I bid thee welcome. If thou art of mortal\nmould, thy valour shall meet its equal: and if thou art a true Knight,\nthou wilt scorn to employ sorcery to carry thy point. Be these omens\nfrom heaven or hell, Manfred trusts to the righteousness of his cause and\nto the aid of St. Nicholas, who has ever protected his house. Alight,\nSir Knight, and repose thyself.",
  "74": " To-morrow thou shalt have a fair field,\nand heaven befriend the juster side!\u201d\n\nThe Knight made no reply, but dismounting, was conducted by Manfred to\nthe great hall of the castle. As they traversed the court, the Knight\nstopped to gaze on the miraculous casque; and kneeling down, seemed to\npray inwardly for some minutes. Rising, he made a sign to the Prince to\nlead on. As soon as they entered the hall, Manfred proposed to the\nstranger to disarm, but the Knight shook his head in token of refusal.\n\n\u201cSir Knight,\u201d said Manfred, \u201cthis is not courteous, but by my good faith\nI will not cross thee, nor shalt thou have cause to complain of the\nPrince of Otranto. No treachery is designed on my part; I hope none is\nintended on thine; here take my gage\u201d (giving him his ring): \u201cyour\nfriends and you shall enjoy the laws of hospitality. Rest here until\nrefreshments are brought. I will but give orders for the accommodation\nof your train, and return to you.\u201d The three Knights bowed as accepting\nhis courtesy. Manfred directed the stranger\u2019s retinue to be conducted to\nan adjacent hospital, founded by the Princess Hippolita for the reception\nof pilgrims. As they made the circuit of the court to return towards the\ngate, the gigantic sword burst from the supporters, and falling to the\nground opposite to the helmet, remained immovable. Manfred, almost\nhardened to preternatural appearances, surmounted the shock of this new\nprodigy; and returning to the hall, where by this time the feast was\nready, he invited his silent guests to take their places. Manfred,\nhowever ill his heart was at ease, endeavoured to inspire the company\nwith mirth. He put several questions to them, but was answered only by\nsigns. They raised their vizors but sufficiently to feed themselves, and\nthat sparingly.\n\n\u201cSirs\u201d said the Prince, \u201cye are the first guests I ever treated within\nthese walls who scorned to hold any intercourse with me: nor has it oft\nbeen customary, I ween, for princes to hazard their state and dignity\nagainst strangers and mutes.",
  "75": " You say you come in the name of Frederic of\nVicenza; I have ever heard that he was a gallant and courteous Knight;\nnor would he, I am bold to say, think it beneath him to mix in social\nconverse with a Prince that is his equal, and not unknown by deeds in\narms. Still ye are silent\u2014well! be it as it may\u2014by the laws of\nhospitality and chivalry ye are masters under this roof: ye shall do your\npleasure. But come, give me a goblet of wine; ye will not refuse to\npledge me to the healths of your fair mistresses.\u201d\n\nThe principal Knight sighed and crossed himself, and was rising from the\nboard.\n\n\u201cSir Knight,\u201d said Manfred, \u201cwhat I said was but in sport. I shall\nconstrain you in nothing: use your good liking. Since mirth is not your\nmood, let us be sad. Business may hit your fancies better. Let us\nwithdraw, and hear if what I have to unfold may be better relished than\nthe vain efforts I have made for your pastime.\u201d\n\nManfred then conducting the three Knights into an inner chamber, shut the\ndoor, and inviting them to be seated, began thus, addressing himself to\nthe chief personage:\u2014\n\n\u201cYou come, Sir Knight, as I understand, in the name of the Marquis of\nVicenza, to re-demand the Lady Isabella, his daughter, who has been\ncontracted in the face of Holy Church to my son, by the consent of her\nlegal guardians; and to require m",
  "76": "e to resign my dominions to your Lord,\nwho gives himself for the nearest of blood to Prince Alfonso, whose soul\nGod rest! I shall speak to the latter article of your demands first.\nYou must know, your Lord knows, that I enjoy the principality of Otranto\nfrom my father, Don Manuel, as he received it from his father, Don\nRicardo. Alfonso, their predecessor, dying childless in the Holy Land,\nbequeathed his estates to my grandfather, Don Ricardo, in consideration\nof his faithful services.\u201d The stranger shook his head.\n\n\u201cSir Knight,\u201d said Manfred, warmly, \u201cRicardo was a valiant and upright\nman; he was a pious man; witness his munificent foundation of the\nadjoining church and two convents. He was peculiarly patronised by St.\nNicholas\u2014my grandfather was incapable\u2014I say, Sir, Don Ricardo was\nincapable\u2014excuse me, your interruption has disordered me. I venerate the\nmemory of my grandfather. Well, Sirs, he held this estate; he held it by\nhis good sword and by the favour of St. Nicholas\u2014so did my father; and\nso, Sirs, will I, come what come will. But Frederic, your Lord, is\nnearest in blood. I have consented to put my title to the issue of the\nsword. Does that imply a vicious title? I might have asked, where is\nFrederic your Lord? Report speaks him dead in captivity. You say, your\nactions say, he lives\u2014I question it not\u2014I might, Sirs, I might\u2014but I do\nnot. Other Princes would bid Frederic take his inheritance by force, if\nhe can: they would not stake their dignity on a single combat: they would\nnot submit it to the decision of unknown mutes!\u2014pardon me, gentlemen, I\nam too warm: but suppose yourselves in my situation: as ye are stout\nKnights, would it not move your choler to have your own and the honour of\nyour ancestors called in question?\u201d \u201cBut to the point.",
  "77": " Ye require me to\ndeliver up the Lady Isabella. Sirs, I must ask if ye are authorised to\nreceive her?\u201d\n\nThe Knight nodded.\n\n\u201cReceive her,\u201d continued Manfred; \u201cwell, you are authorised to receive\nher, but, gentle Knight, may I ask if you have full powers?\u201d\n\nThe Knight nodded.\n\n\u201c\u2019Tis well,\u201d said Manfred; \u201cthen hear what I have to offer. Ye see,\ngentlemen, before you, the most unhappy of men!\u201d (he began to weep);\n\u201cafford me your compassion; I am entitled to it, indeed I am. Know, I\nhave lost my only hope, my joy, the support of my house\u2014Conrad died\nyester morning.\u201d\n\nThe Knights discovered signs of surprise.\n\n\u201cYes, Sirs, fate has disposed of my son. Isabella is at liberty.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you then restore her?\u201d cried the chief Knight, breaking silence.\n\n\u201cAfford me your patience,\u201d said Manfred. \u201cI rejoice to find, by this\ntestimony of your goodwill, that this matter may be adjusted without\nblood. It is no interest of mine dictates what little I have farther to\nsay. Ye behold in me a man disgusted with the world: the loss of my son\nhas weaned me from earthly cares. Power and greatness have no longer any\ncharms in my eyes. I wished to transmit the sceptre I had received from\nmy ancestors with honour to my son\u2014but that is over! Life itself is so\nindifferent to me, that I accepted your defiance with joy. A good Knight\ncannot go to the grave with more satisfaction than when falling in his\nvocation: whatever is the will of heaven, I submit; for alas! Sirs, I am\na man of many sorrows. Manfred is no object of envy, but no doubt you\nare acquainted with my story.\u201d\n\nThe Knight made signs of ignorance, and seemed curious to have Manfred\nproceed.",
  "78": "\n\n\u201cIs it possible, Sirs,\u201d continued the Prince, \u201cthat my story should be a\nsecret to you? Have you heard nothing relating to me and the Princess\nHippolita?\u201d\n\nThey shook their heads.\n\n\u201cNo! Thus, then, Sirs, it is. You think me ambitious: ambition, alas!\nis composed of more rugged materials. If I were ambitious, I should not\nfor so many years have been a prey to all the hell of conscientious\nscruples. But I weary your patience: I will be brief. Know, then, that\nI have long been troubled in mind on my union with the Princess\nHippolita. Oh! Sirs, if ye were acquainted with that excellent woman! if\nye knew that I adore her like a mistress, and cherish her as a friend\u2014but\nman was not born for perfect happiness! She shares my scruples, and with\nher consent I have brought this matter before the church, for we are\nrelated within the forbidden degrees. I expect every hour the definitive\nsentence that must separate us for ever\u2014I am sure you feel for me\u2014I see\nyou do\u2014pardon these tears!\u201d\n\nThe Knights gazed on each other, wondering where this would end.\n\nManfred continued\u2014\n\n\u201cThe death of my son betiding while my soul was under this anxiety, I\nthought of nothing but resigning my dominions, and retiring for ever from\nthe sight of mankind. My only difficulty was to fix on a successor, who\nwould be tender of my people, and to dispose of the Lady Isabella, who is\ndear to me as my own blood.",
  "79": " I was willing to restore the line of\nAlfonso, even in his most distant kindred. And though, pardon me, I am\nsatisfied it was his will that Ricardo\u2019s lineage should take place of his\nown relations; yet where was I to search for those relations? I knew of\nnone but Frederic, your Lord; he was a captive to the infidels, or dead;\nand were he living, and at home, would he quit the flourishing State of\nVicenza for the inconsiderable principality of Otranto? If he would not,\ncould I bear the thought of seeing a hard, unfeeling, Viceroy set over my\npoor faithful people? for, Sirs, I love my people, and thank heaven am\nbeloved by them. But ye will ask whither tends this long discourse?\nBriefly, then, thus, Sirs. Heaven in your arrival seems to point out a\nremedy for these difficulties and my misfortunes. The Lady Isabella is\nat liberty; I shall soon be so. I would submit to anything for the good\nof my people. Were it not the best, the only way to extinguish the feuds\nbetween our families, if I was to take the Lady Isabella to wife? You\nstart.",
  "80": " But though Hippolita\u2019s virtues will ever be dear to me, a Prince\nmust not consider himself; he is born for his people.\u201d A servant at that\ninstant entering the chamber apprised Manfred that Jerome and several of\nhis brethren demanded immediate access to him.\n\nThe Prince, provoked at this interruption, and fearing that the Friar\nwould discover to the strangers that Isabella had taken sanctuary, was\ngoing to forbid Jerome\u2019s entrance. But recollecting that he was\ncertainly arrived to notify the Princess\u2019s return, Manfred began to\nexcuse himself to the Knights for leaving them for a few moments, but was\nprevented by the arrival of the Friars. Manfred angrily reprimanded them\nfor their intrusion, and would have forced them back from the chamber;\nbut Jerome was too much agitated to be repulsed. He declared aloud the\nflight of Isabella, with protestations of his own innocence.\n\nManfred, distracted at the news, and not less at its coming to the\nknowledge of the strangers, uttered nothing but incoherent sentences, now\nupbraiding the Friar, now apologising to the Knights, earnest to know\nwhat was become of Isabella, yet equally afraid of their knowing;\nimpatient to pursue her, yet dreading to have them join in the pursuit.\nHe offered to despatch messengers in quest of her, but the chief Knight,\nno longer keeping silence, reproached Manfred in bitter terms for his\ndark and ambiguous dealing, and demanded the cause of Isabella\u2019s first\nabsence from the castle. Manfred, casting a stern look at Jerome,\nimplying a command of silence, pretended that on Conrad\u2019s death he had\nplaced her in sanctuary until he could determine how to dispose of her.\nJerome, who trembled for his son\u2019s life, did not dare contradict this\nfalsehood, but one of his brethren, not under the same anxiety, declared\nfrankly that she had fled to their church in the preceding night. The\nPrince in vain endeavoured to stop this discovery, which overwhelmed him\nwith shame and confusion.",
  "81": " The principal stranger, amazed at the\ncontradictions he heard, and more than half persuaded that Manfred had\nsecreted the Princess, notwithstanding the concern he expressed at her\nflight, rushing to the door, said\u2014\n\n\u201cThou traitor Prince! Isabella shall be found.\u201d\n\nManfred endeavoured to hold him, but the other Knights assisting their\ncomrade, he broke from the Prince, and hastened into the court, demanding\nhis attendants. Manfred, finding it vain to divert him from the pursuit,\noffered to accompany him and summoning his attendants, and taking Jerome\nand some of the Friars to guide them, they issued from the castle;\nManfred privately giving orders to have the Knight\u2019s company secured,\nwhile to the knight he affected to despatch a messenger to require their\nassistance.\n\nThe company had no sooner quitted the castle than Matilda, who felt\nherself deeply interested for the young peasant, since she had seen him\ncondemned to death in the hall, and whose thoughts had been taken up with\nconcerting measures to save him, was informed by some of the female\nattendants that Manfred had despatched all his men various ways in\npursuit of Isabella. He had in his hurry given this order in general\nterms, not meaning to extend it to the guard he had set upon Theodore,\nbut forgetting it. The domestics, officious to obey so peremptory a\nPrince, and urged by their own curiosity and love of novelty to join in\nany precipitate chase, had to a man left the castle.",

They listened; but\nperceiving no further noise, they both concluded it the effect of pent-up\nvapours. And the Princess, preceding Theodore softly, carried him to her\nfather\u2019s armoury, where, equipping him with a complete suit, he was\nconducted by Matilda to the postern-gate.\n\n\u201cAvoid the town,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cand all the western side of the\ncastle.",
  "85": " \u2019Tis there the search must be making by Manfred and the\nstrangers; but hie thee to the opposite quarter. Yonder behind that\nforest to the east is a chain of rocks, hollowed into a labyrinth of\ncaverns that reach to the sea coast. There thou mayst lie concealed,\ntill thou canst make signs to some vessel to put on shore, and take thee\noff. Go! heaven be thy guide!\u2014and sometimes in thy prayers\nremember\u2014Matilda!\u201d\n\nTheodore flung himself at her feet, and seizing her lily hand, which with\nstruggles she suffered him to kiss, he vowed on the earliest opportunity\nto get himself knighted, and fervently entreated her permission to swear\nhimself eternally her knight. Ere the Princess could reply, a clap of\nthunder was suddenly heard that shook the battlements. Theodore,\nregardless of the tempest, would have urged his suit: but the Princess,\ndismayed, retreated hastily into the castle, and commanded the youth to\nbe gone with an air that would not be disobeyed. He sighed, and retired,\nbut with eyes fixed on the gate, until Matilda, closing it, put an end to\nan interview, in which the hearts of both had drunk so deeply of a\npassion, which both now tasted for the first time.\n\nTheodore went pensively to the convent, to acquaint his father with his\ndeliverance. There he learned the absence of Jerome, and the pursuit\nthat was making after the Lady Isabella, with some particulars of whose\nstory he now first became acquainted. The generous gallantry of his\nnature prompted him to wish to assist her; but the Monks could lend him\nno lights to guess at the route she had taken. He was not tempted to\nwander far in search of her, for the idea of Matilda had imprinted itself\nso strongly on his heart, that he could not bear to absent himself at\nmuch distance from her abode. The tenderness Jerome had expressed for\nhim concurred to confirm this reluctance; and he even persua",
  "86": "ded himself\nthat filial affection was the chief cause of his hovering between the\ncastle and monastery.\n\nUntil Jerome should return at night, Theodore at length determined to\nrepair to the forest that Matilda had pointed out to him. Arriving\nthere, he sought the gloomiest shades, as best suited to the pleasing\nmelancholy that reigned in his mind. In this mood he roved insensibly to\nthe caves which had formerly served as a retreat to hermits, and were now\nreported round the country to be haunted by evil spirits. He recollected\nto have heard this tradition; and being of a brave and adventurous\ndisposition, he willingly indulged his curiosity in exploring the secret\nrecesses of this labyrinth. He had not penetrated far before he thought\nhe heard the steps of some person who seemed to retreat before him.\n\nTheodore, though firmly grounded in all our holy faith enjoins to be\nbelieved, had no apprehension that good men were abandoned without cause\nto the malice of the powers of darkness. He thought the place more\nlikely to be infested by robbers than by those infernal agents who are\nreported to molest and bewilder travellers. He had long burned with\nimpatience to approve his valour. Drawing his sabre, he marched sedately\nonwards, still directing his steps as the imperfect rustling sound before\nhim led the way. The armour he wore was a like indication to the person\nwho avoided him. Theodore, now convinced that he was not mistaken,\nredoubled his pace, and evidently gained on the person that fled, whose\nhaste increasing, Theodore came up just as a woman fell breathless before\nhim. He hasted to raise her, but her terror was so great that he\napprehended she would faint in his arms. He used every gentle word to\ndispel her alarms, and assured her that far from injuring, he would\ndefend her at the peril of his life.",
  "87": " The Lady recovering her spirits\nfrom his courteous demeanour, and gazing on her protector, said\u2014\n\n\u201cSure, I have heard that voice before!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot to my knowledge,\u201d replied Theodore; \u201cunless, as I conjecture, thou\nart the Lady Isabella.\u201d\n\n\u201cMerciful heaven!\u201d cried she. \u201cThou art not sent in quest of me, art\nthou?\u201d And saying those words, she threw herself at his feet, and\nbesought him not to deliver her up to Manfred.\n\n\u201cTo Manfred!\u201d cried Theodore\u2014\u201cno, Lady; I have once already delivered\nthee from his tyranny, and it shall fare hard with me now, but I will\nplace thee out of the reach of his daring.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it possible,\u201d said she, \u201cthat thou shouldst be the generous unknown\nwhom I met last night in the vault of the castle? Sure thou art not a\nmortal, but my guardian angel.

If heaven has selected me for thy deliverer,\nit will accomplish its work, and strengthen my arm in thy cause. But\ncome, Lady, we are too near the mouth of the cavern; let us seek its\ninmost recesses.

I meant to conduct you into the most\nprivate cavity of these rocks, and then at the hazard of my life to guard\ntheir entrance against every living thing.",
  "88": " Besides, Lady,\u201d continued he,\ndrawing a deep sigh, \u201cbeauteous and all perfect as your form is, and\nthough my wishes are not guiltless of aspiring, know, my soul is\ndedicated to another; and although\u2014\u201d A sudden noise prevented Theodore\nfrom proceeding. They soon distinguished these sounds\u2014\n\n\u201cIsabella! what, ho! Isabella!\u201d The trembling Princess relapsed into her\nformer agony of fear. Theodore endeavoured to encourage her, but in\nvain. He assured her he would die rather than suffer her to return under\nManfred\u2019s power; and begging her to remain concealed, he went forth to\nprevent the person in search of her from approaching.\n\nAt the mouth of the cavern he found an armed Knight, discoursing with a\npeasant, who assured him he had seen a lady enter the passes of the rock.\nThe Knight was preparing to seek her, when Theodore, placing himself in\nhis way, with his sword drawn, sternly forbad him at his peril to\nadvance.\n\n\u201cAnd who art thou, who darest to cross my way?\u201d said the Knight,\nhaughtily.\n\n\u201cOne who does not dare more than he will perform,\u201d said Theodore.\n\n\u201cI seek the Lady Isabella,\u201d said the Knight, \u201cand understand she has\ntaken refuge among these rocks.

  "89": "\u201d\n\nThe stranger, who was the principal Knight that had arrived from the\nMarquis of Vicenza, had galloped from Manfred as he was busied in getting\ninformation of the Princess, and giving various orders to prevent her\nfalling into the power of the three Knights. Their chief had suspected\nManfred of being privy to the Princess\u2019s absconding, and this insult from\na man, who he concluded was stationed by that Prince to secrete her,\nconfirming his suspicions, he made no reply, but discharging a blow with\nhis sabre at Theodore, would soon have removed all obstruction, if\nTheodore, who took him for one of Manfred\u2019s captains, and who had no\nsooner given the provocation than prepared to support it, had not\nreceived the stroke on his shield. The valour that had so long been\nsmothered in his breast broke forth at once; he rushed impetuously on the\nKnight, whose pride and wrath were not less powerful incentives to hardy\ndeeds. The combat was furious, but not long. Theodore wounded the\nKnight in three several places, and at last disarmed him as he fainted by\nthe loss of blood.\n\nThe peasant, who had fled on the first onset, had given the alarm to some\nof Manfred\u2019s domestics, who, by his orders, were dispersed through the\nforest in pursuit of Isabella. They came up as the Knight fell, whom\nthey soon discovered to be the noble stranger. Theodore, notwithstanding\nhis hatred to Manfred, could not behold the victory he had gained without\nemotions of pity and generosity. But he was more touched when he learned\nthe quality of his adversary, and was informed that he was no retainer,\nbut an enemy, of Manfred. He assisted the servants of the latter in\ndisarming the Knight, and in endeavouring to stanch the blood that flowed\nfrom his wounds.",

Matilda blushed at seeing Theodore and Isabella together;\nbut endeavoured to conceal it by embracing the latter, and condoling with\nher on her father\u2019s mischance. The surgeons soon came to acquaint\nHippolita that none of the Marquis\u2019s wounds were dangerous; and that he\nwas desirous of seeing his daughter and the Princesses.",
  "93": "\n\nTheodore, under pretence of expressing his joy at being freed from his\napprehensions of the combat being fatal to Frederic, could not resist the\nimpulse of following Matilda. Her eyes were so often cast down on\nmeeting his, that Isabella, who regarded Theodore as attentively as he\ngazed on Matilda, soon divined who the object was that he had told her in\nthe cave engaged his affections. While this mute scene passed, Hippolita\ndemanded of Frederic the cause of his having taken that mysterious course\nfor reclaiming his daughter; and threw in various apologies to excuse her\nLord for the match contracted between their children.\n\nFrederic, however incensed against Manfred, was not insensible to the\ncourtesy and benevolence of Hippolita: but he was still more struck with\nthe lovely form of Matilda. Wishing to detain them by his bedside, he\ninformed Hippolita of his story. He told her that, while prisoner to the\ninfidels, he had dreamed that his daughter, of whom he had learned no\nnews since his captivity, was detained in a castle, where she was in\ndanger of the most dreadful misfortunes: and that if he obtained his\nliberty, and repaired to a wood near Joppa, he would learn more. Alarmed\nat this dream, and incapable of obeying the direction given by it, his\nchains became more grievous than ever. But while his thoughts were\noccupied on the means of obtaining his liberty, he received the agreeable\nnews that the confederate Princes who were warring in Palestine had paid\nhis ransom. He instantly set out for the wood that had been marked in\nhis dream.\n\nFor three days he and his attendants had wandered in the forest without\nseeing a human form: but on the evening of the third they came to a cell,\nin which they found a venerable hermit in the agonies of death.",

When first I repaired to this solitude, after seeing\nmy country become a prey to unbelievers\u2014it is alas! above fifty years\nsince I was witness to that dreadful scene! St. Nicholas appeared to me,\nand revealed a secret, which he bade me never disclose to mortal man, but\non my death-bed. This is that tremendous hour, and ye are no doubt the\nchosen warriors to whom I was ordered to reveal my trust. As soon as ye\nhave done the last offices to this wretched corse, dig under the seventh\ntree on the left hand of this poor cave, and your pains will\u2014Oh! good\nheaven receive my soul!\u201d With those words the devout man breathed his\nlast.\n\n\u201cBy break of day,\u201d continued Frederic, \u201cwhen we had committed the holy\nrelics to earth, we dug according to direction.

Hippolita trembled. She did not doubt but Frederic was\ndestined by heaven to accomplish the fate that seemed to threaten her\nhouse. Looking with anxious fondness at Matilda, a silent tear stole\ndown her cheek: but recollecting herself, she said\u2014\n\n\u201cProceed, my Lord; heaven does nothing in vain; mortals must receive its\ndivine behests with lowliness and submission.",

The dignity and\npatient firmness of Hippolita penetrated him with respect, and the tender\nsilent affection with which the Princess and her daughter regarded each\nother, melted him almost to tears. Yet apprehensive that his forbearance\nto obey would be more alarming, he repeated in a faltering and low voice\nthe following lines:\n\n    \u201cWhere\u2019er a casque that suits this sword is found,\n    With perils is thy daughter compass\u2019d round;\n    _Alfonso\u2019s_ blood alone can save the maid,\n    And quiet a long restless Prince\u2019s shade.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is there in these lines,\u201d said Theodore impatiently, \u201cthat affects\nthese Princesses?

  "97": " \u201cDost thou not see him? can\nit be my brain\u2019s delirium?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis! my Lord,\u201d said Hippolita; \u201cthis is Theodore, the youth who has\nbeen so unfortunate.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheodore!\u201d said Manfred mournfully, and striking his forehead; \u201cTheodore\nor a phantom, he has unhinged the soul of Manfred. But how comes he\nhere? and how comes he in armour?\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe he went in search of Isabella,\u201d said Hippolita.\n\n\u201cOf Isabella!\u201d said Manfred, relapsing into rage; \u201cyes, yes, that is not\ndoubtful\u2014. But how did he escape from durance in which I left him? Was\nit Isabella, or this hypocritical old Friar, that procured his\nenlargement?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd would a parent be criminal, my Lord,\u201d said Theodore, \u201cif he\nmeditated the deliverance of his child?\u201d\n\nJerome, amazed to hear himself in a manner accused by his son, and\nwithout foundation, knew not what to think. He could not comprehend how\nTheodore had escaped, how he came to be armed, and to encounter Frederic.\nStill he would not venture to ask any questions that might tend to\ninflame Manfred\u2019s wrath against his son. Jerome\u2019s silence convinced\nManfred that he had contrived Theodore\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cAnd is it thus, thou ungrateful old man,\u201d said the Prince, addressing\nhimself to the Friar, \u201cthat thou repayest mine and Hippolita\u2019s bounties?\nAnd not content with traversing my heart\u2019s nearest wishes, thou armest\nthy bastard, and bringest him into my own castle to insult me!\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d said Theodore, \u201cyou wrong my father: neither he nor I are\ncapable of harbouring a thought against your peace.

There is not a\nsentiment engraven on my heart that does not venerate you and yours.\u201d\n\nThe grace and fervour with which Theodore uttered these words interested\nevery person present in his favour. Even Manfred was touched\u2014yet still\npossessed with his resemblance to Alfonso, his admiration was dashed with\nsecret horror.\n\n\u201cRise,\u201d said he; \u201cthy life is not my present purpose. But tell me thy\nhistory, and how thou camest connected with this old traitor here.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d said Jerome eagerly.\n\n\u201cPeace! impostor!\u201d said Manfred; \u201cI will not have him prompted.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d said Theodore, \u201cI want no assistance; my story is very brief.\nI was carried at five years of age to Algiers with my mother, who had\nbeen taken by corsairs from the coast of Sicily.

  "99": " Destitute and friendless, hopeless almost of attaining\nthe transport of a parent\u2019s embrace, I took the first opportunity of\nsetting sail for Naples, from whence, within these six days, I wandered\ninto this province, still supporting myself by the labour of my hands;\nnor until yester-morn did I believe that heaven had reserved any lot for\nme but peace of mind and contented poverty. This, my Lord, is Theodore\u2019s\nstory. I am blessed beyond my hope in finding a father; I am unfortunate\nbeyond my desert in having incurred your Highness\u2019s displeasure.\u201d\n\nHe ceased. A murmur of approbation gently arose from the audience.\n\n\u201cThis is not all,\u201d said Frederic; \u201cI am bound in honour to add what he\nsuppresses.

They separated each to her chamber, with more expressions of\nceremony and fewer of affection than had passed between them since their\nchildhood.\n\nIf they parted with small cordiality, they did but meet with greater\nimpatience, as soon as the sun was risen. Their minds were in a\nsituation that excluded sleep, and each recollected a thousand questions\nwhich she wished she had put to the other overnight. Matilda reflected\nthat Isabella had been twice delivered by Theodore in very critical\nsituations, which she could not believe accidental.",
  "101": " His eyes, it was\ntrue, had been fixed on her in Frederic\u2019s chamber; but that might have\nbeen to disguise his passion for Isabella from the fathers of both. It\nwere better to clear this up. She wished to know the truth, lest she\nshould wrong her friend by entertaining a passion for Isabella\u2019s lover.\nThus jealousy prompted, and at the same time borrowed an excuse from\nfriendship to justify its curiosity.\n\nIsabella, not less restless, had better foundation for her suspicions.\nBoth Theodore\u2019s tongue and eyes had told her his heart was engaged; it\nwas true\u2014yet, perhaps, Matilda might not correspond to his passion; she\nhad ever appeared insensible to love: all her thoughts were set on\nheaven.\n\n\u201cWhy did I dissuade her?\u201d said Isabella to herself; \u201cI am punished for my\ngenerosity; but when did they meet? where? It cannot be; I have deceived\nmyself; perhaps last night was the first time they ever beheld each\nother; it must be some other object that has prepossessed his\naffections\u2014if it is, I am not so unhappy as I thought; if it is not my\nfriend Matilda\u2014how!

This attitude, so\ncorrespondent to what she felt herself, revived Isabella\u2019s suspicions,\nand destroyed the confidence she had purposed to place in her friend.\nThey blushed at meeting, and were too much novices to disguise their\nsensations with address. After some unmeaning questions and replies,\nMatilda demanded of Isabella the cause of her flight?

  "103": "\u201d\n\n\u201cServed me!\u201d replied Isabella; \u201cdo you term it serving me, to wound my\nfather, and almost occasion his death? Though it is but since yesterday\nthat I am blessed with knowing a parent, I hope Matilda does not think I\nam such a stranger to filial tenderness as not to resent the boldness of\nthat audacious youth, and that it is impossible for me ever to feel any\naffection for one who dared to lift his arm against the author of my\nbeing. No, Matilda, my heart abhors him; and if you still retain the\nfriendship for me that you have vowed from your infancy, you will detest\na man who has been on the point of making me miserable for ever.\u201d\n\nMatilda held down her head and replied: \u201cI hope my dearest Isabella does\nnot doubt her Matilda\u2019s friendship: I never beheld that youth until\nyesterday; he is almost a stranger to me: but as the surgeons have\npronounced your father out of danger, you ought not to harbour\nuncharitable resentment against one, who I am persuaded did not know the\nMarquis was related to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou plead his cause very pathetically,\u201d said Isabella, \u201cconsidering he\nis so much a stranger to you! I am mistaken, or he returns your\ncharity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat mean you?\u201d said Matilda.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Isabella, repenting that she had given Matilda a hint of\nTheodore\u2019s inclination for her. Then changing the discourse, she asked\nMatilda what occasioned Manfred to take Theodore for a spectre?\n\n\u201cBless me,\u201d said Matilda, \u201cdid not you observe his extreme resemblance to\nthe portrait of Alfonso in the gallery? I took notice of it to Bianca\neven before I saw him in armour; but with the helmet on, he is the very\nimage of that picture.",
  "104": "\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not much observe pictures,\u201d said Isabella: \u201cmuch less have I\nexamined this young man so attentively as you seem to have done.

Each confessed\nto the other the impression that Theodore had made on her; and this\nconfidence was followed by a struggle of generosity, each insisting on\nyielding her claim to her friend. At length the dignity of Isabella\u2019s\nvirtue reminding her of the preference which Theodore had almost declared\nfor her rival, made her determine to conquer her passion, and cede the\nbeloved object to her friend.\n\nDuring this contest of amity, Hippolita entered her daughter\u2019s chamber.\n\n\u201cMadam,\u201d said she to Isabella, \u201cyou have so much tenderness for Matilda,\nand interest yourself so kindly in whatever affects our wretched house,\nthat I can have no secrets with my child which are not proper for you to\nhear.\u201d\n\nThe princesses were all attention and anxiety.\n\n\u201cKnow then, Madam,\u201d continued Hippolita, \u201cand you my dearest Matilda,\nthat being convinced by all the eve",

Jerome was heartily\ngrieved to discover his son\u2019s inclination for that princess; and leaving\nhim to his rest, promised in the morning to acquaint him with important\nreasons for conquering his passion.",
  "111": "\n\nTheodore, like Isabella, was too recently acquainted with parental\nauthority to submit to its decisions against the impulse of his heart.\nHe had little curiosity to learn the Friar\u2019s reasons, and less\ndisposition to obey them. The lovely Matilda had made stronger\nimpressions on him than filial affection. All night he pleased himself\nwith visions of love; and it was not till late after the morning-office,\nthat he recollected the Friar\u2019s commands to attend him at Alfonso\u2019s tomb.\n\n\u201cYoung man,\u201d said Jerome, when he saw him, \u201cthis tardiness does not\nplease me.

I can forget injuries, but never\nbenefits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe injuries thou hast received from Manfred\u2019s race,\u201d said the Friar,\n\u201care beyond what thou canst conceive.",

Jerome frowned.\n\nHippolita then acquainted the Friar with the proposal she had suggested\nto Manfred, his approbation of it, and the tender of Matilda that he was\ngone to make to Frederic. Jerome could not conceal his dislike of the\nnotion, which he covered under pretence of the improbability that\nFrederic, the nearest of blood to Alfonso, and who was come to claim his\nsuccession, would yield to an alliance with the usurper of his right.\nBut nothing could equal the perplexity of the Friar, when Hippolita\nconfessed her readiness not to oppose the separation, and demanded his\nopinion on the legality of her acquiescence. The Friar caught eagerly at\nher request of his advice, and without explaining his aversion to the\nproposed marriage of Manfred and Isabella, he painted to Hippolita in the\nmost alarming colours the sinfulness of her consent, denounced judgments\nagainst her if she complied, and enjoined her in the severest terms to\ntreat any such proposition with every mark of indignation and refusal.\n\nManfred, in the meantime, had broken his purpose to Frederic, and\nproposed the double marriage.",

He made faint opposition\nto the proposal; affecting, for form only, not to acquiesce unless\nHippolita should consent to the divorce. Manfred took that upon himself.\n\nTransported with his success, and impatient to see himself in a situation\nto expect sons, he hastened to his wife\u2019s apartment, determined to extort\nher compliance.

  "117": "\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nEvery reflection which Manfred made on the Friar\u2019s behaviour, conspired\nto persuade him that Jerome was privy to an amour between Isabella and\nTheodore. But Jerome\u2019s new presumption, so dissonant from his former\nmeekness, suggested still deeper apprehensions. The Prince even\nsuspected that the Friar depended on some secret support from Frederic,\nwhose arrival, coinciding with the novel appearance of Theodore, seemed\nto bespeak a correspondence. Still more was he troubled with the\nresemblance of Theodore to Alfonso\u2019s portrait. The latter he knew had\nunquestionably died without issue. Frederic had consented to bestow\nIsabella on him. These contradictions agitated his mind with numberless\npangs.\n\nHe saw but two methods of extricating himself from his difficulties. The\none was to resign his dominions to the Marquis\u2014pride, ambition, and his\nreliance on ancient prophecies, which had pointed out a possibility of\nhis preserving them to his posterity, combated that thought. The other\nwas to press his marriage with Isabella. After long ruminating on these\nanxious thoughts, as he marched silently with Hippolita to the castle, he\nat last discoursed with that Princess on the subject of his disquiet, and\nused every insinuating and plausible argument to extract her consent to,\neven her promise of promoting the divorce. Hippolita needed little\npersuasions to bend her to his pleasure. She endeavoured to win him over\nto the measure of resigning his dominions; but finding her exhortations\nfruitless, she assured him, that as far as her conscience would allow,\nshe would raise no opposition to a separation, though without better\nfounded scruples than what he yet alleged, she would not engage to be\nactive in demanding it.\n\nThis compliance, though inadequate, was sufficient to raise Manfred\u2019s\nhopes. He trusted that his power and wealth would easily advance his\nsuit at the court of Rome, whither he resolved to engage Frederic to take\na journey on purpose.",
  "118": " That Prince had discovered so much passion for\nMatilda, that Manfred hoped to obtain all he wished by holding out or\nwithdrawing his daughter\u2019s charms, according as the Marquis should appear\nmore or less disposed to co-operate in his views. Even the absence of\nFrederic would be a material point gained, until he could take further\nmeasures for his security.\n\nDismissing Hippolita to her apartment, he repaired to that of the\nMarquis; but crossing the great hall through which he was to pass he met\nBianca. The damsel he knew was in the confidence of both the young\nladies. It immediately occurred to him to sift her on the subject of\nIsabella and Theodore. Calling her aside into the recess of the oriel\nwindow of the hall, and soothing her with many fair words and promises,\nhe demanded of her whether she knew aught of the state of Isabella\u2019s\naffections.\n\n\u201cI! my Lord! no my Lord\u2014yes my Lord\u2014poor Lady! she is wonderfully alarmed\nabout her father\u2019s wounds; but I tell her he will do well; don\u2019t your\nHighness think so?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not ask you,\u201d replied Manfred, \u201cwhat she thinks about her father;\nbut you are in her secrets.

The latter, more upon his\nguard than Manfred wished, declined his frequent challenges, on pretence\nof his late loss of blood; while the Prince, to raise his own disordered\nspirits, and to counterfeit unconcern, indulged himself in plentiful\ndraughts, though not to the intoxication of his senses.\n\nThe evening being far advanced, the banquet concluded. Manfred would\nhave withdrawn with Frederic; but the latter pleading weakness and want\nof repose, retired to his chamber, gallantly telling the Prince that his\ndaughter should amuse his Highness until himself could attend him.\nManfred accepted the party, and to the no small grief of Isabella,\naccompanied her to her apartment. Matilda waited on her mother to enjoy\nthe freshness of the evening on the ramparts of the castle.",
  "127": "\n\nSoon as the company were dispersed their several ways, Frederic, quitting\nhis chamber, inquired if Hippolita was alone, and was told by one of her\nattendants, who had not noticed her going forth, that at that hour she\ngenerally withdrew to her oratory, where he probably would find her. The\nMarquis, during the repast, had beheld Matilda with increase of passion.\nHe now wished to find Hippolita in the disposition her Lord had promised.\nThe portents that had alarmed him were forgotten in his desires.\nStealing softly and unobserved to the apartment of Hippolita, he entered\nit with a resolution to encourage her acquiescence to the divorce, having\nperceived that Manfred was resolved to make the possession of Isabella an\nunalterable condition, before he would grant Matilda to his wishes.\n\nThe Marquis was not surprised at the silence that reigned in the\nPrincess\u2019s apartment. Concluding her, as he had been advertised, in her\noratory, he passed on. The door was ajar; the evening gloomy and\novercast. Pushing open the door gently, he saw a person kneeling before\nthe altar.",
  "128": " As he approached nearer, it seemed not a woman, but one in a\nlong woollen weed, whose back was towards him. The person seemed\nabsorbed in prayer. The Marquis was about to return, when the figure,\nrising, stood some moments fixed in meditation, without regarding him.\nThe Marquis, expecting the holy person to come forth, and meaning to\nexcuse his uncivil interruption, said,\n\n\u201cReverend Father, I sought the Lady Hippolita.\u201d\n\n\u201cHippolita!\u201d replied a hollow voice; \u201ccamest thou to this castle to seek\nHippolita?\u201d and then the figure, turning slowly round, discovered to\nFrederic the fleshless jaws and empty sockets of a skeleton, wrapt in a\nhermit\u2019s cowl.\n\n\u201cAngels of grace protect me!\u201d cried Frederic, recoiling.\n\n\u201cDeserve their protection!\u201d said the Spectre. Frederic, falling on his\nknees, adjured the phantom to take pity on him.\n\n\u201cDost thou not remember me?\u201d said the apparition. \u201cRemember the wood of\nJoppa!\u201d\n\n\u201cArt thou that holy hermit?\u201d cried Frederic, trembling. \u201cCan I do aught\nfor thy eternal peace?\u201d\n\n\u201cWast thou delivered from bondage,\u201d said the spectre, \u201cto pursue car",
  "129": "nal\ndelights? Hast thou forgotten the buried sabre, and the behest of Heaven\nengraven on it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have not, I have not,\u201d said Frederic; \u201cbut say, blest spirit, what is\nthy errand to me? What remains to be done?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo forget Matilda!\u201d said the apparition; and vanished.\n\nFrederic\u2019s blood froze in his veins. For some minutes he remained\nmotionless. Then falling prostrate on his face before the altar, he\nbesought the intercession of every saint for pardon. A flood of tears\nsucceeded to this transport; and the image of the beauteous Matilda\nrushing in spite of him on his thoughts, he lay on the ground in a\nconflict of penitence and passion. Ere he could recover from this agony\nof his spirits, the Princess Hippolita with a taper in her hand entered\nthe oratory alone. Seeing a man without motion on the floor, she gave a\nshriek, concluding him dead. Her fright brought Frederic to himself.\nRising suddenly, his face bedewed with tears, he would have rushed from\nher presence; but Hippolita stopping h",
  "130": "im, conjured him in the most\nplaintive accents to explain the cause of his disorder, and by what\nstrange chance she had found him there in that posture.\n\n\u201cAh, virtuous Princess!\u201d said the Marquis, penetrated with grief, and\nstopped.\n\n\u201cFor the love of Heaven, my Lord,\u201d said Hippolita, \u201cdisclose the cause of\nthis transport! What mean these doleful sounds, this alarming\nexclamation on my name? What woes has heaven still in store for the\nwretched Hippolita? Yet silent! By every pitying angel, I adjure thee,\nnoble Prince,\u201d continued she, falling at his feet, \u201cto disclose the\npurport of what lies at thy heart. I see thou feelest for me; thou\nfeelest the sharp pangs that thou inflictest\u2014speak, for pity! Does aught\nthou knowest concern my child?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot speak,\u201d cried Frederic, bursting from her. \u201cOh, Matilda!\u201d\n\nQuitting the Princess thus abruptly, he hastened to his own apartment.\nAt the door of it he was accosted by Manfred, who flushed by wine and\nlove had come to seek him, and to propose to waste some hours of the\nnight in music and revelling. Frederic, offended at an invitation so\ndissonant from the mood of his soul, pushed him rudely aside, and\nentering his chamber, flung the door intemperately against Manfred, and\nbolted it inwards. The haughty Prince, enraged at this unaccountable\nbehaviour, withdrew in a frame of mind capable of the most fatal\nexcesses. As he crossed the court, he was met by the domestic whom he\nhad planted at the convent as a spy on Jerome and Theodore. This man,\nalmost breathless with the haste he had made, informed his Lord that\nTheodore, and some lady from the castle were, at that instant, in private\nconference at the tomb of Alfonso in St.",
  "131": " Nicholas\u2019s church. He had\ndogged Theodore thither, but the gloominess of the night had prevented\nhis discovering who the woman was.\n\nManfred, whose spirits were inflamed, and whom Isabella had driven from\nher on his urging his passion with too little reserve, did not doubt but\nthe inquietude she had expressed had been occasioned by her impatience to\nmeet Theodore. Provoked by this conjecture, and enraged at her father,\nhe hastened secretly to the great church. Gliding softly between the\naisles, and guided by an imperfect gleam of moonshine that shone faintly\nthrough the illuminated windows, he stole towards the tomb of Alfonso, to\nwhich he was directed by indistinct whispers of the persons he sought.\nThe first sounds he could distinguish were\u2014\n\n\u201cDoes it, alas! depend on me? Manfred will never permit our union.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this shall prevent it!\u201d cried the tyrant, drawing his dagger, and\nplunging it over her shoulder into the bosom of the person that spoke.\n\n\u201cAh, me, I am slain!\u201d cried Matilda, sinking. \u201cGood heaven, receive my\nsoul!\u201d\n\n\u201cSavage, inhuman monster, what hast thou done!\u201d cried Theodore, rushing\non him, and wrenching his dagger from him.\n\n\u201cStop, stop thy impious hand!\u201d cried Matilda; \u201cit is my father!\u201d\n\nManfred, waking as from a trance, beat his breast, twisted his hands in\nhis locks, and endeavoured to recover his dagger from Theodore to\ndespatch himself. Theodore, scarce less distracted, and only mastering\nthe transports of his grief to assist Matilda, had now by his cries drawn\nsome of the monks to his aid.",
  "132": " While part of them endeavoured, in concert\nwith the afflicted Theodore, to stop the blood of the dying Princess, the\nrest prevented Manfred from laying violent hands on himself.\n\nMatilda, resigning herself patiently to her fate, acknowledged with looks\nof grateful love the zeal of Theodore. Yet oft as her faintness would\npermit her speech its way, she begged the assistants to comfort her\nfather. Jerome, by this time, had learnt the fatal news, and reached the\nchurch. His looks seemed to reproach Theodore, but turning to Manfred,\nhe said,\n\n\u201cNow, tyrant! behold the completion of woe fulfilled on thy impious and\ndevoted head! The blood of Alfonso cried to heaven for vengeance; and\nheaven has permitted its altar to be polluted by assassination, that thou\nmightest shed thy own blood at the foot of that Prince\u2019s sepulchre!\u201d\n\n\u201cCruel man!\u201d cried Matilda, \u201cto aggravate the woes of a parent; may\nheaven bless my father, and forgive him as I do! My Lord, my gracious\nSire, dost thou forgive thy child? Indeed, I came not hither to meet\nTheodore. I found him praying at this tomb, whither my mother sent me to\nintercede for thee, for her\u2014dearest father, bless your child, and say you\nforgive her.\u201d\n\n\u201cForgive thee! Murderous monster!\u201d cried Manfred, \u201ccan assassins\nforgive? I took thee for Isabella; but heaven directed my bloody hand to\nthe heart of my child. Oh, Matilda!\u2014I cannot utter it\u2014canst thou forgive\nthe blindness of my rage?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can, I do; and may heaven confirm it!\u201d said Matilda; \u201cbut while I have\nlife to ask it\u2014oh! my mother! what will she feel? Will you comfort her,\nmy Lord? Will you not put her away? Indeed she loves you! Oh, I am\nfaint! bear me to the castle. Can I live to have her close my eyes?\u201d\n\nTheodore and the monks besought her earnestly to suffer herself to be\nborne into the convent; but her instances were so pressing to be carried\nto the castle, that placing her on a litter, they conveyed her thither as\nshe requested.",
  "133": " Theodore, supporting her head with his arm, and hanging\nover her in an agony of despairing love, still endeavoured to inspire her\nwith hopes of life. Jerome, on the other side, comforted her with\ndiscourses of heaven, and holding a crucifix before her, which she bathed\nwith innocent tears, prepared her for her passage to immortality.\nManfred, plunged in the deepest affliction, followed the litter in\ndespair.\n\nEre they reached the castle, Hippolita, informed of the dreadful\ncatastrophe, had flown to meet her murdered child; but when she saw the\nafflicted procession, the mightiness of her grief deprived her of her\nsenses, and she fell lifeless to the earth in a swoon. Isabella and\nFrederic, who attended her, were overwhelmed in almost equal sorrow.\nMatilda alone seemed insensible to her own situation: every thought was\nlost in tenderness for her mother.\n\nOrdering the litter to stop, as soon as Hippolita was brought to herself,\nshe asked for her father. He approached, unable to speak. Matilda,\nseizing his hand and her mother\u2019s, locked them in her own, and then\nclasped them to her heart. Manfred could not support this act of\npathetic piety. He dashed himself on the ground, and cursed the day he\nwas born. Isabella, apprehensive that these struggles of passion were\nmore than Matilda could support, took upon herself to order Manfred to be\nborne to his apartment, while she caused Matilda to be conveyed to the\nnearest chamber. Hippolita, scarce more alive than her daughter, was\nregardless of everything but her; but when the tender Isabella\u2019s care\nwould have likewise removed her, while the surgeons examined Matilda\u2019s\nwound, she cried,\n\n\u201cRemove me! never, never! I lived but in her, and will expire with her.\u201d\n\nMatilda raised her eyes at her mother\u2019s voice, but closed them again\nwithout speaking.",
  "134": " Her sinking pulse and the damp coldness of her hand\nsoon dispelled all hopes of recovery. Theodore followed the surgeons\ninto the outer chamber, and heard them pronounce the fatal sentence with\na transport equal to frenzy.\n\n\u201cSince she cannot live mine,\u201d cried he, \u201cat least she shall be mine in\ndeath! Father! Jerome! will you not join our hands?\u201d cried he to the\nFriar, who, with the Marquis, had accompanied the surgeons.\n\n\u201cWhat means thy distracted rashness?\u201d said Jerome. \u201cIs this an hour for\nmarriage?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is, it is,\u201d cried Theodore. \u201cAlas! there is no other!\u201d\n\n\u201cYoung man, thou art too unadvised,\u201d said Frederic. \u201cDost thou think we\nare to listen to thy fond transports in this hour of fate? What\npretensions hast thou to the Princess?\u201d\n\n\u201cThose of a Prince,\u201d said Theodore; \u201cof the sovereign of Otranto. This\nreverend man, my father, has informed me who I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cThou ravest,\u201d said the Marquis. \u201cThere is no Prince of Otranto but\nmyself, now Manfred, by murder, by sacrilegious murder, has forfeited all\npretensions.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d said Jerome, assuming an air of command, \u201che tells you true.\nIt was not my purpose the secret should have been divulged so soon, but\nfate presses onward to its work. What his hot-headed passion has\nrevealed, my tongue confirms. Know, Prince, that when Alfonso set sail\nfor the Holy Land\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this a season for explanations?\u201d cried Theodore. \u201cFather, come and\nunite me to the Princess; she shall be mine! In every other thing I will\ndutifully obey you. My life! my adored Matilda!\u201d continued Theodore,\nrushing back into the inner chamber, \u201cwill you not be mine? Will you not\nbless your\u2014\u201d\n\nIsabella made signs to him to be silent, apprehending the Princess was\nnear her end.",
  "135": "\n\n\u201cWhat, is she dead?\u201d cried Theodore; \u201cis it possible!\u201d\n\nThe violence of his exclamations brought Matilda to herself. Lifting up\nher eyes, she looked round for her mother.\n\n\u201cLife of my soul, I am here!\u201d cried Hippolita; \u201cthink not I will quit\nthee!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! you are too good,\u201d said Matilda. \u201cBut weep not for me, my mother!\nI am going where sorrow never dwells\u2014Isabella, thou hast loved me;\nwouldst thou not supply my fondness to this dear, dear woman? Indeed I\nam faint!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! my child! my child!\u201d said Hippolita in a flood of tears, \u201ccan I not\nwithhold thee a moment?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will not be,\u201d said Matilda; \u201ccommend me to heaven\u2014Where is my father?\nforgive him, dearest mother\u2014forgive him my death; it was an error. Oh!\nI had forgotten\u2014dearest mother, I vowed never to see Theodore\nmore\u2014perhaps that has drawn down this calamity\u2014but it was not\nintentional\u2014can you pardon me?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! wound not my agonising soul!\u201d said Hippolita; \u201cthou never couldst\noffend me\u2014Alas! she faints! help! help!\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say something more,\u201d said Matilda, struggling, \u201cbut it cannot\nbe\u2014Isabella\u2014Theodore\u2014for my sake\u2014Oh!\u2014\u201d she expired.\n\nIsabella and her women tore Hippolita from the corse; but Theodore\nthreatened destruction to all who attempted to remove him from it.",
  "136": " He\nprinted a thousand kisses on her clay-cold hands, and uttered every\nexpression that despairing love could dictate.\n\nIsabella, in the meantime, was accompanying the afflicted Hippolita to\nher apartment; but, in the middle of the court, they were met by Manfred,\nwho, distracted with his own thoughts, and anxious once more to behold\nhis daughter, was advancing to the chamber where she lay. As the moon\nwas now at its height, he read in the countenances of this unhappy\ncompany the event he dreaded.\n\n\u201cWhat! is she dead?\u201d cried he in wild confusion. A clap of thunder at\nthat instant shook the castle to its foundations; the earth rocked, and\nthe clank of more than mortal armour was heard behind. Frederic and\nJerome thought the last day was at hand. The latter, forcing Theodore\nalong with them, rushed into the court. The moment Theodore appeared,\nthe walls of the castle behind Manfred were thrown down with a mighty\nforce, and the form of Alfonso, dilated to an immense magnitude, appeared\nin the centre of the ruins.\n\n\u201cBehold in Theodore the true heir of Alfonso!\u201d said the vision: And\nhaving pronounced those words, accompanied by a clap of thunder, it\nascended solemnly towards heaven, where the clouds parting asunder, the\nform of St. Nicholas was seen, and receiving Alfonso\u2019s shade, they were\nsoon wrapt from mortal eyes in a blaze of glory.\n\nThe beholders fell prostrate on their faces, acknowledging the divine\nwill. The first that broke silence was Hippolita.\n\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d said she to the desponding Manfred, \u201cbehold the vanity of\nhuman greatness! Conrad is gone! Matilda is no more! In Theodore we\nview the true Prince of Otranto.",
  "137": " By what miracle he is so I know\nnot\u2014suffice it to us, our doom is pronounced! shall we not, can we but\ndedicate the few deplorable hours we have to live, in deprecating the\nfurther wrath of heaven? heaven ejects us\u2014whither can we fly, but to yon\nholy cells that yet offer us a retreat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThou guiltless but unhappy woman! unhappy by my crimes!\u201d replied\nManfred, \u201cmy heart at last is open to thy devout admonitions. Oh!\ncould\u2014but it cannot be\u2014ye are lost in wonder\u2014let me at last do justice on\nmyself! To heap shame on my own head is all the satisfaction I have left\nto offer to offended heaven.

List, sirs, and\nmay this bloody record be a warning to future tyrants!\u201d\n\n\u201cAlfonso, ye all know, died in the Holy Land\u2014ye would interrupt me; ye\nwould say he came not fairly to his end\u2014it is most true\u2014why else this\nbitter cup which Manfred must drink to the dregs.

  "138": " Haunted by his guilt he vowed to St. Nicholas to found a church and\ntwo convents, if he lived to reach Otranto. The sacrifice was accepted:\nthe saint appeared to him in a dream, and promised that Ricardo\u2019s\nposterity should reign in Otranto until the rightful owner should be\ngrown too large to inhabit the castle, and as long as issue male from\nRicardo\u2019s loins should remain to enjoy it\u2014alas! alas! nor male nor\nfemale, except myself, remains of all his wretched race! I have done\u2014the\nwoes of these three days speak the rest. How this young man can be\nAlfonso\u2019s heir I know not\u2014yet I do not doubt it. His are these\ndominions; I resign them\u2014yet I knew not Alfonso had an heir\u2014I question\nnot the will of heaven\u2014poverty and prayer must fill up the woeful space,\nuntil Manfred shall be summoned to Ricardo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat remains is my part to declare,\u201d said Jerome. \u201cWhen Alfonso set\nsail for the Holy Land he was driven by a storm to the coast of Sicily.\nThe other vessel, which bore Ricardo and his train, as your Lordship must\nhave heard, was separated from him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is most true,\u201d said Manfred; \u201cand the title you give me is more than\nan outcast can claim\u2014well! be it so\u2014proceed.\u201d\n\nJerome blushed, and continued. \u201cFor three months Lord Alfonso was\nwind-bound in Sicily. There he became enamoured of a fair virgin named\nVictoria. He was too pious to tempt her to forbidden pleasures. They\nwere married. Yet deeming this amour incongruous with the holy vow of\narms by which he was bound, he determined to conceal their nuptials until\nhis return from the Crusade, when he purposed to seek and acknowledge her\nfor his lawful wife. He left her pregnant. During his absence she was\ndelivered of a daughter. But scarce had she felt a mother\u2019s pangs ere\nshe heard the fatal rumour of her Lord\u2019s death, and the succession of\nRicardo.",
  "139": " What could a friendless, helpless woman do? Would her\ntestimony avail?\u2014yet, my lord, I have an authentic writing\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt needs not,\u201d said Manfred; \u201cthe horrors of these days, the vision we\nhave but now seen, all corroborate thy evidence beyond a thousand\nparchments.

The daughter of which Victoria\nwas delivered, was at her maturity bestowed in marriage on me. Victoria\ndied; and the secret remained locked in my breast. Theodore\u2019s narrative\nhas told the rest.\u201d\n\nThe Friar ceased. The disconsolate company retired to the remaining part\nof the castle. In the morning Manfred signed his abdication of the\nprincipality, with the approbation of Hippolita, and each took on them\nthe habit of religion in the neighbouring convents. Frederic offered his\ndaughter to the new Prince, which Hippolita\u2019s tenderness for Isabella\nconcurred to promote. But Theodore\u2019s grief was too fresh to admit the\nthought of another love; and it was not until after frequent discourses\nwith Isabella of his dear Matilda, that he was persuaded he could know no\nhappiness but in the society of one with whom he could for ever indulge\nthe melancholy that had taken possession of his soul."
